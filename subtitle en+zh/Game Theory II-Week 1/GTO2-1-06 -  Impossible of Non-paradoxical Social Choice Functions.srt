in this lecture we'll speak about social

6
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:17,220
known and we have discussed that before
已知，我们之前已经讨论过

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:22,690
now it might be thought that the problem
现在可能会认为问题出在

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,699
lies in the fact that social welfare
在于社会福利

9
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,879
functions require you to specify as an

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:29,949
output of the process and entire

ordering and that might be highly

constraining but if you only need it to

00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,858
paradoxes it turns out that the answer
矛盾的是，答案

16
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:47,108
is no but first we need to sort of

17
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:49,178
redefine our criteria a little bit
重新定义我们的标准

18
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:52,928
because the notions of Pareto efficiency

21
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,248
the context of a social choice function

22
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:04,810
but we will see that there are closely
但我们会发现

23
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,619
related notions that are well defined so
定义明确的相关概念

24
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,988
let's first define weak Pareto

25
00:01:11,188 --> 00:01:11,649
efficiency
效率

26
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:14,230
and we'll say that a software choice

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,209
function C is weakly Pareto efficient if

outcome or candidate so if there is a a

31
00:01:35,938 --> 00:01:38,918
other candidate or one that is always

32
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,128
preferred to Oh - by every by every
喜欢哦-每个人一个

33
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:45,250
voter then the weaker candidate Oh -
选民再弱者候选人哦- 

34
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,439
would never be elected seems like a
永远不会当选似乎

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,448
reasonable criterion and we'll call that

39
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,340
monotonicity and informally as I written

40
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:06,849
here at the at the bottom it says that

41
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,160
if you have a winner if we increase the

remain a winner so formally speaking

00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,849
through the proof but the intuition is

102
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:40,840
founded dictatorial obviously so the

theorem says it cannot be monotonic

intuitive you might think it is

105
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,990
monotonic but here's a counter example

106
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:54,939
so here are these seven agents and there

107
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:01,150
are three preference profiles the three

109
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:09,009
clearly then a would be the winner under

110
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:12,220
poor ality because three agents would

we modify this we modify this preference

117
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,110
to a remain the same so clear surely you

118
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,980
would say a as is doing as well as it

119
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,319
would have done originally and
本来可以做到的， 

120
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:51,759
monotonicity would say that your

121
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,410
children the winner but clearly in this
