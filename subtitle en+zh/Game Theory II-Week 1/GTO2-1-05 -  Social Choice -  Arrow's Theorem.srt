1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,139
so in this video we're going to look at
所以在这个视频中，我们将要看

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,819
arrows theorem and prove it formally so
箭头定理并正式证明它

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:09,069
to begin let's establish the notation
首先让我们建立符号

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:11,040
that we'll use throughout this video
我们将在整个视频中使用

5
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:16,329
I'll let n be the set of agents I'll let
我将让n为代理

6
00:00:16,528 --> 00:00:18,970
L be a finite set of outcomes so these
我是有限的一组结果

7
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,679
are the candidates that the agents are
是代理商的候选人

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,079
going to have preferences over and the
将有偏好，并且

9
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:25,720
really important thing about o is going

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,550
to be that there are at least three

11
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,530
candidates so arrows theorem is going to

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:31,510
require that we have at least three

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,929
candidates that we're voting over I'm

14
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,919
going to use I all to denote the set of
我将用所有这些来表示

15
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:41,409
all possible strict preference orderings

16
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:45,128
over o so I'm going to be speaking here

17
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,559
only about strict orderings that means

18
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,779
that agents don't have any ties in their

19
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:53,259
preferences in the end arrows theorem is

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,509
going to end up telling us that any

00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,649
desirable social welfare function can't

exist even if preferences are restricted

23
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:05,079
to be strict so this restriction to

notation here to denote an element of

31
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:25,719
the set L to the N so in other words

32
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,939
this is going to be a preference profile

52
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,789
precisely which ordering it is so so in
确切地说是这样的顺序

53
00:02:25,989 --> 00:02:28,039
particular this notation here is going

54
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,679
to mean the preference order in output

59
00:02:39,939 --> 00:02:46,759
it is that I talk about okay so now let

60
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,980
me formally state the conditions that

unanimous if even one person feels

72
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:22,069
all so formally I'll say that a social

should be true for every pair of

because the relative rankings are the

653
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,339
is that there has to be some dictator

654
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:56,299
over a B pairs and so if n star was able

655
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,029
to make any difference to a B pairs he

makes a difference to the a B ranking

660

661
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:13,669
star and M star must be the same agent

everything and start is just a full

social welfare function I have if it's
