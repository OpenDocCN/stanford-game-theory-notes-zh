then if it observes that its opponent

cooperate forever but if it plays

trigger so you can see that in both of

between them can also be a best response

143
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,420
for me so that there's a sense in which

144
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,009
I can have an infinite number of mixed
我可以有无数的混合

145
00:05:33,209 --> 00:05:35,050
strategy equilibria but here I can have

146
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,670
an infinite number of qualitatively

147
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,430
different pure strategy equilibria

148
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,910
potentially that seems like a problem so

149
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,020
we're not going to be able to somehow

150
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,329
list off the equilibria necessarily of a

151
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:49,210
repeated game interestingly there is
有趣的是重复游戏

152
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,340
still something that we can coherently

153
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,290
do to give a satisfying answer about the

00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,218
games and in this video I'm going to

156
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,500
tell you what it is and actually because

157
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,060
it's so satisfying I'm even going to
真的很满足，我什至会去

158
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,290
prove this theorem to you so you'll

really will understand how this one

160
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,090
works and here's the idea of the theorem

that we will eventually prove we can

characterize what payoffs can be

give an example of equilibrium

without giving every equilibrium that

167
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,290
results in those paths so we're going to

168
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,840
kind of characterize which strategies
表征哪些策略

169
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,230
are in equilibrium in infinitely

repeated games sort of via their payoffs

precisely which payoff vectors are

174
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,540
I need to give you a little bit of

175
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,319
notation so we
符号，所以我们

176
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:43,929
talk about these payoff vectors so this
谈论这些收益向量

177
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:45,819
is kind of our slide of notation once we

178
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:47,020
get through this we're gonna have all

00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,369
the building blocks we need to prove out

181
00:06:51,658 --> 00:06:55,718
and player game so this is just our

182
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:57,660
stage game some normal form game and

183
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,069
we're also going to start with some
我们也将从一些

184
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:02,230
payoff vector here and by this what I

185
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,209
mean is the utilities that the players
意思是玩家的效用

186
00:07:04,408 --> 00:07:07,059
get in the game now in this video I'm
我现在在这个视频中加入游戏

187
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:09,009
gonna talk about the average reward case

190
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:17,619
average by following my strategy in the
通过遵循我在

191
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,809
infinitely repeated game and so that's
无限重复的游戏，所以

192
00:07:20,009 --> 00:07:22,240
gonna say I care just in the same way

193
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,520
about payoffs that I get now and payoffs

194
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,139
that I get a million iterations into the

196
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,170
we can do something similar in the
我们可以在

197
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,209
discounted reward case and that's gonna
打折的奖励案例，那将会

198
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:32,709
be the topic of a different video but
是另一部影片的主题，但

199
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:33,968
for this video we're gonna talk only
对于这个视频，我们只会说

200
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:36,278
about the average reward case and the
关于平均奖励情况和

201
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:37,600
reason is the proof is a little bit

202
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
easier to think about in the average

203
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,170
reward case even though the discounted

204
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,410
reward reward case is maybe a bit more

205
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,480
of a practical setting we can get across
我们可以了解的实际环境

206
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,850
the the key ideas of both proofs by this

207
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:52,959
proof and this one's a bit easier so so
证明，这有点容易，所以

208
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:55,930
let's do it to do that I need to remind
让我们做到这一点，我需要提醒

209
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:58,389
you of the concept of the min Max value
最小最大值的概念

210
00:07:58,589 --> 00:08:01,959
here which is something that we kind of
这是我们有点

211
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:03,850
introduced in the concept of zero-sum
零和概念引入

212
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,079
games but it turns out to be very

213
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:06,759
important for repeated games so I'm
对于重复游戏很重要，所以我

214
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,050
going to remind you of what it is here
会让你想起这里的一切

215
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,569
so this is the mathematical definition
所以这是数学上的定义

216
00:08:10,769 --> 00:08:14,829
of the mid max value but let me start by
最大值的中间值，但让我开始

217
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:16,119
saying in words what it means because
用语言说这是什么意思，因为

218
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,639
the the nested min and Max operators are
嵌套的min和Max运算符是

219
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,100
a little bit hard to think about
有点难以思考

220
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,079
essentially with what eyes min Max value
本质上用最小的眼睛看最大值

221
00:08:23,278 --> 00:08:27,430
is is it's the amount of utility that
是它的实用性

222
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:30,218
player I is able to obtain for himself

223
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:33,370
if all of the other players who we call

224
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,069
- I are completely unconcerned about
 -我完全不关心

225
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:38,439
their own utility and instead they're
他们自己的实用程序，而是

226
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:40,479
just trying to hurt I as much as
只是想尽可能地伤害我

227
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,500
possible so they all play that strategy

228
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,889
from their joint mixed strategy space
从他们联合的混合策略空间

229
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:51,669
that if I respond to that by doing the
如果我通过做出回应

230
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,229
best thing that I can for himself
我能为自己做的最好的事情

231
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:58,429
then eyes utility is as low as possible
那么眼睛的实用性越低

232
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:00,919
so they're trying to minimize eyes
所以他们正在努力减少眼睛

233
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,189
utility given that I is trying to
鉴于我正在尝试实用

234
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:05,569
maximize in response to their

235
00:09:05,769 --> 00:09:08,870
minimization and the number that comes
最小化和随之而来的数量

236
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,179
out at the end is the amount of utility
最后是效用的数量

237
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:15,078
that I can get by doing as best he can
我可以尽他所能

238
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:16,939
against everybody trying to hurt him as

239
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:17,809
much as possible
尽可能多

240
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:20,839
so that's eyes min max value so
所以眼睛最小最大值

241
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:24,198
intuitively if I want to punish you as
如果我想惩罚你

242
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,909
much as possible in a game and you know

243
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,059
that I'm trying to punish you that's the

244
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:30,620
amount of utility that you get is your
您获得的实用程序数量是您的

245
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,639
min Max value so I will say that a
最小值最大值，所以我会说

246
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,519
payoff profile remember a payoff profile
支付配置文件记住支付配置文件

247
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:41,109
is a payoff amount for everybody is
是每个人的回报金额是

248
00:09:41,309 --> 00:09:43,008
enforceable or give it the name

249
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,969
enforceable if it's the case that

250
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,839
everybody's payoff and that payoff
每个人的回报，那回报

251
00:09:48,039 --> 00:09:51,559
profile is at least their min Max value
个人资料至少是其最小值，最大值

252
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,779
so if anybody is getting less than their
所以如果有人比他们少

253
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,609
min Max value in a given payoff profile
最小给定收益曲线中的最大值

254
00:09:55,809 --> 00:09:57,919
I will say that that's an unenforceable
我会说那是无法执行的

255
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,629
payoff profile and I will say that a
还清个人资料，我会说

256
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,689
payoff profile is feasible you I'll use
我将使用支付配置文件是可行的

257
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:08,449
this technical term feasible if the

260
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,109
feasibility is that it's possible to
可行性是有可能

261
00:10:15,309 --> 00:10:17,508
actually get that payoff profile by
实际通过

262
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,909
combining together payoffs in the actual

game that's being played
正在玩的游戏

264
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,549
notice that enforceability doesn't

265
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,799
actually require that it's possible you
实际要求有可能

266
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,529
know I could say the payoff 1 million

prisoner's dilemma is an enforceable
囚徒困境是可以执行的

269
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,929
payoff profile because it's above both

270
00:10:33,129 --> 00:10:35,120
of our min Max values but there's no way

274
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:41,539
going to talk about what it's actually

330
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:43,740
is a feasible payoff in this game on the

00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,719
feasible in this game and the reason is

me to get a payoff of 2 this would have

than 1 this condition over here would be

416
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:31,740
of the theorem statement which has to do
定理陈述的说明

417
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,700
with the fact that we're talking about
我们正在谈论的事实

418
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,649
feasibility here and we're not talking
这里的可行性，我们不是在谈论

419
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:37,500
about it here so we can't conclude that
关于它，所以我们不能得出结论

420
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,210
every Nash equilibrium is feasible you
每个纳什均衡都是可行的

421
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,950
might wonder why that is that's just
可能想知道为什么那只是

422
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,299
because some of them aren't expressible
因为其中一些无法表达

423
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,039
as rationals some of them they alphas

424
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,139
wouldn't be rational so so that's the
不会是理性的，所以这是

425
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:47,309
part that I'm kind of leaving out of
我有点忽略的部分

426
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:49,200
this proof but that that's a technical
这个证明，但这是技术上的

427
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,240
point so the broad thing that you should
指出如此广泛的事情

428
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,059
remember about the folk theorem is that

429
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:55,349
basically feasibility and enforceability

you wanted to stop here you now know

achievable in a Nash equilibrium that I

493
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:39,099
been in Nash equilibrium and so that

494
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,789
leads us to to derive a contradiction
导致我们产生矛盾

495
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,129
from our assumption that we made at the
根据我们在

496
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:46,450
beginning that our was not enforceable
开始我们无法执行

497
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,240
so you can see we can conclude that if R

498
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,549
is not enforceable we we can't have a
无法执行，我们无法

499
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,149
Nash equilibrium and and that that been

503
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,269
kind of the easy direction and the less

504
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,519
interesting direction let's now do the

505
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,200
the second and more interesting part

506
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,529
which says all I need to assume is that
这说明我需要假设的是

507
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,329
the payoff profile is both feasible and
收益概况既可行又可行

508
00:21:16,529 --> 00:21:19,119
enforceable and that means that I have

509
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,369
found a Nash equilibrium and what's
发现了纳什均衡，什么是

510
00:21:21,569 --> 00:21:22,569
interesting about this part is that
这部分有趣的是

511
00:21:22,769 --> 00:21:24,639
we're going to do it by construction so
我们将通过施工来做到这一点

512
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:27,250
I'm going to show you how if you're
我要告诉你如何

513
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:29,740
given any feasible and enforceable
给出任何可行且可执行的

514
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,190
payoff profile you can build a set of
您可以建立一套

515
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,200
strategies for both players which are in
双方球员的策略

516
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,460
equilibrium with respect to each other
彼此平衡

517
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:39,190
and which obtain exactly that average
并获得准确的平均值

518
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:44,289
payoff for both players so first of all
双方球员的回报，所以首先

519
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:45,460
let's just kind of introduce some
让我们来介绍一些

520
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,139
bookkeeping notation that we'll use here
我们将在此处使用的簿记符号

521
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:48,230
so
所以

522
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:51,769
since our is feasible and since we've
因为我们可行，而且

523
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:53,710
assumed that these alphas are rational
假设这些alpha是合理的

524
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:59,859
then we can write each RI as follows so
那么我们可以如下写每个RI 

525
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,589
basically we can make up new variables
基本上我们可以组成新的变量

526
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:08,180
beta a and gamma where we replace each
 beta a和gamma，我们分别替换

527
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,119
alpha a by beta a divided by gamma and
 alpha a除以beta a除以gamma和

528
00:22:13,319 --> 00:22:15,799
basically that's not hard to do because
基本上这并不难，因为

529
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,599
we know that the Alpha is irrational so
我们知道Alpha是不合理的

530
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,819
we know that we it's possible to write
我们知道我们可以写

531
00:22:20,019 --> 00:22:21,879
each of these alphas as a fraction and
这些alpha分别作为分数和

532
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:24,529
then we can make gamma into their common
然后我们可以将伽玛变成它们的共同点

533
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,359
denominator and we can set the betas
分母，我们可以设置beta 

534
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,730
appropriately and then it's possible to
适当地，然后有可能

535
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,009
come up with betas and gammas that make
提出了使

536
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,159
this expression true so so so that
这个表达如此真实，以至于

537
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,509
shouldn't be too surprising that just
应该不会太惊讶

538
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:37,069
follows from from the fact that these
从这些事实

539
00:22:37,269 --> 00:22:41,490
alphas are rational and from feasibility
 alpha是合理且可行的

540
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:44,419
now I'm going to construct a strategy
现在我要制定一个策略

541
00:22:44,619 --> 00:22:46,460
profile and then on the next slide I'm
个人资料，然后在下一张幻灯片上

542
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,169
going to argue to you that that strategy
会跟你说那个策略

543
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:51,259
profile is in equilibrium or that we can
轮廓处于平衡状态，或者我们可以

544
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,649
turn it into an equilibrium so let's
把它变成平衡，让我们

545
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:56,450
make a strategy profile that cycles
制定一个循环的战略概况

546
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,690
through all of the outcomes using cycles
使用周期遍历所有结果

547
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,149
of length gamma and the way it's going
伽玛的长度及其发展方式

548
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:04,339
to work is that it's each cycle is going
工作是每个周期都在进行

549
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:07,700
to repeat action a exactly beta a times
重复执行一次完全beta的操作

550
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,869
so we're gonna have our kind of game
所以我们要有自己的游戏

551
00:23:12,069 --> 00:23:16,730
matrix here and remember beta and gamma
在这里矩阵并记住beta和gamma 

552
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,930
are both integers so so for example
