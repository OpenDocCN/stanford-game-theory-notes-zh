about repeated games when players

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,510
discount the future payoffs and let's

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,030
talk about more about that and what that

discounted repeated games the idea is

we're looking at games where players are

10
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,230
over again but instead of looking at the

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,629
terms of discounting and so the idea

32
00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:19,719
here is is if I misbehave today now I

stage game just take a normal form game

going to be taken to be in zero one

strictly less than one

69
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:42,700
some cases and then the idea of

70
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,830
discounting is then the payoff that you

00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,069
get from a whole sequence of action so

75
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:59,679
up these payoffs but now you weight them

78
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,759
the power of T so if I care you know I

00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,960
idea okay so when we look at these games

we played this game what did everyone do

93
00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:06,550
got 81 to etienne so these things are

98
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:17,649
histories so all possible histories that

could be faced with when I'm playing

every possible history into a possibly

people can either cooperate or defect in

about a history of lengths three one
关于长度三的历史

114
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,400
possibility would be the following

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,230
we both cooperated in the first period

117
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:58,000
period and then both of them defected in

118
00:04:58,199 --> 00:04:59,620
the third period so that would be a
第三期，所以将是

119
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,000
possible history and then they could say
可能的历史，然后他们可以说

120
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,620
okay now what are we going to do in in

121
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:05,290
the fourth period maybe will that

bygones be bygones and try and get back

we're angry at each other who knows okay

125
00:05:12,269 --> 00:05:13,689
so a strategy for a fourth period would

126
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,990
be what what you do after you've seen

different histories of the first three

128
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,480
periods so sub-game perfection again

129
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,910
same as usual profile of strategies that

130
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,340
are nash in every sub game what is the

131
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,520
sub game here sub games are just start

in some period and talk about what

equilibrium following every possible

137
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,270
for forever on so strategies now are

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,710
going to be specifications of what we

think a little bit about the logic of

say forget it we're going to defect

201
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:08,230
we get three in perpetuity right so we

202
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:10,778
get three plus beta times three so take

00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,909
gonna manage to change from cooperate to

216
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,679
period but then they're gonna see that

220
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:51,878
opportunity we get a bunch of ones right

00:08:55,948 --> 00:08:58,538
beta times one beta squared and so forth

224
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:02,258
here this is just beta times a 1 plus a

225
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,688
beta is 1 and so forth this is beta
 beta是1，依此类推，这是beta 

226
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:07,209
times 1 over 1 minus beta so if I
 1乘以1减去beta，所以如果我

227
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:09,399
deviate what happens is in the first

229
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:14,529
the subsequent periods so there's a

230
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,628
trade-off and how big that trade-off is

00:09:16,828 --> 00:09:18,218
depends on the size of the discount

232
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:22,149
factor so we've got these two different

233
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,558
payoffs we can look at the difference

between these if I stay cooperating

235
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,508
instead of defecting I'm giving up two

236
00:09:28,708 --> 00:09:30,818
today I could I could gain by defecting
今天我可以从叛逃中获益

237
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:33,128
but then I keep the benefits of

238
00:09:33,328 --> 00:09:35,108
cooperation in the future so I don't
未来的合作，所以我不会

239
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,998
ruin things and that that means that I'm
毁了东西，这意味着我

240
00:09:37,198 --> 00:09:38,918
getting a bunch of twos extras in the
在中获得一堆的二三

241
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:41,468
future and so when you look at this the
未来，所以当你看着这个

242
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,959
value of this is beta times 2 over 1
它的值是beta乘以2比1 

243
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,389
minus beta minus the 2 and for going

244
00:09:46,589 --> 00:09:49,089
today and when do I want to keep

245
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:51,368
cooperating as long as this is not
只要这不是合作

246
00:09:51,568 --> 00:09:53,288
negative right this becomes negative
消极的权利，这变成消极的

247
00:09:53,489 --> 00:09:56,468
then I'm worse off today by cooperating
那么我今天的合作更糟

248
00:09:56,668 --> 00:09:58,899
it might as well just affect so
它可能也是如此影响

249
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,788
difference is not negative if this thing
如果这件事差异不为负

250
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:04,029
is such that beta is greater than 1

252
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:08,948
greater than or equal to 1/2 so if you

253
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:10,358
just go through the algebra of solving
只是经历求解的代数

tomorrow at least half as much as today

262
00:10:25,318 --> 00:10:27,639
looking at this this payoffs this payoff
看着这个回报这个回报

263
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,918
structure here then we've got a

264
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:33,758
situation where beta has to be they if
 Beta必须是他们的情况，如果

265

can sustain cooperation in this finitely

囚徒困境好吗

269
00:10:45,928 --> 00:10:48,698
so let's change the numbers a little bit

270
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:53,078
and see what happens so now let's try

271
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,838
and make defection a little bit more
使叛变多一点

272
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:58,988
attractive right so instead of 5 we'll

273
00:10:59,188 --> 00:11:00,608
make it worth 10 to defect
使它值得10缺陷

274
00:11:00,808 --> 00:11:03,219
so now defection looks really attractive

275
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:06,370
what what has to happen well we can go
