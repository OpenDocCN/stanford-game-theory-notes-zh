1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,468
hi again folks so let's talk a little
大家好，再说一遍

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:03,879
bit about a folk theorem now for a
现在谈谈一个民间定理

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,469
discounted repeated game so we're in the
打折重复游戏，所以我们在

4
00:00:05,669 --> 00:00:08,169
case where there's a discount factor and
有折扣因素的情况下

5
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:10,149
people care more about today than the
人们比今天更关心

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,750
future or tomorrow and so forth and we
未来或明天等等，我们

7
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:17,320
want to think about the expansion of the
想考虑的扩展

8
00:00:17,519 --> 00:00:19,510
logic that we just went through and some
我们刚刚经历的逻辑和一些

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,970
examples but see whether that holds in a
例子，但看看是否在

10
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,539
general setting of repeated games so
重复游戏的一般设置

11
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:26,859
what's the folk theorem what's the
民间定理是什么

12
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,728
extension to repeated games so take a
扩展到重复游戏，因此

13
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:34,239
normal forma game and so there's
正常的形式游戏，所以有

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:36,969
actually very many versions of folk
其实民间的版本很多

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,559
theorems and we'll do a very particular
定理，我们将做一个非常特别的

16
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:41,198
one which has I think the basic

17
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:43,779
intuition behind it and a fairly simple
背后的直觉和相当简单

18
00:00:43,979 --> 00:00:46,599
proof so the idea is is we're looking at
证明，所以我们的想法是

19
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,419
some Nash equilibrium of the stage game
阶段游戏的纳什均衡

20
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,448
so take a stage game find a profile
所以参加一个舞台游戏找到一个个人资料

21
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,038
which is a Nash equilibrium of the stage
这是阶段的纳什均衡

22
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,099
game and then also look for some
游戏，然后还寻找一些

23
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:02,169
alternative strategy and here we have a

24
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:04,149
couple of typos that should be in a
错别字应该在

25
00:01:04,349 --> 00:01:07,769
prime so look for some alternative

26
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:12,039
strategy a prime such that everybody

27
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,829
gets a strictly higher payoff from a

28
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,778
prime than a ok where a is the Nash
优胜于OK，那是纳什

29
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:22,418
equilibrium then there exists some
平衡，然后存在一些

30
00:01:22,618 --> 00:01:25,959
discount factor below one such that if

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,058
everybody has a discount factor above

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,840
played in every period on the

36
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,549
equilibrium path so what this is telling

37
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,099
us is the logic that we went through in

38
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,988
those two examples of prisoners dilemmas

41
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,679
game find a Nash equilibrium of that and

find something which is better than that

45
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,939
the same logic that we did in those

49
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:10,029
and and basically the proof of this

50
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,630
theorem is is very similar to what we

51
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,640
went through in those examples so the

idea is is you know we'll play a prime

as long as everybody plays it

gonna go to a grim trigger we're just

61
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:35,170
future to offset the game the game from

62
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:37,570
today so in terms of the the proof

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,590
game so we need to check will anybody

72
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:02,590
has in the past and we can bound the

73
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:04,900
game so an upper bound on the gain is

74
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,300
the maximum over all players and all

us a maximum possible gain the minimum

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,640
period per period loss so this is the

80
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,319
maximum they can gain from today well

84
00:03:28,669 --> 00:03:30,939
instead of getting a prime they're not

00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:35,319
going to go to a so that's that and and

you know is really the minimum relative

to the Nash equilibrium or could they

91
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,969
gain so think about this a little bit

92
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:53,380
why wouldn't they want to change from

99
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,900
the best possible payoff if the other

possible game the minimum possible loss

players are doing the maximum possible

108
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:33,550
the future and this should be an AI then

we've got beta I over 1 minus beta I and
我们的Beta I超过1减去Beta I，并且

110
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:41,350

has to be non-negative sorry has to be

113
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:52,749
want to deviate so what do we need we
想偏离，所以我们需要什么

114
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,379
need that M is less than or equal to
需要M小于或等于

115
00:04:56,579 --> 00:04:58,959
this so M over m is less than or equal
因此，M大于m小于或等于

116
00:04:59,158 --> 00:05:03,939
to beta I over 1 minus beta I and that
超过1的beta I减去beta I， 

117
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:06,790
gives us a lower bound on beta I it has
给了我们它的beta的下限

118
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,480
to be at least M over m plus m so that's

119
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,850
a not a tight lower bound in the sense

00:05:18,658 --> 00:05:20,588
discount factor then you can sustain

straightforward generalization of the

125
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:27,399
examples we looked through before and

126
00:05:27,598 --> 00:05:30,160
it's showing us that we can sustain

131
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:44,410
one thing to think about you could you

132
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,509
can sustain fairly complicated play if
