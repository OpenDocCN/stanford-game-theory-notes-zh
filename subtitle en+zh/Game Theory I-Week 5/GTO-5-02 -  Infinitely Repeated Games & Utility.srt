1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,509
in this video we're going to look at how
在本视频中，我们将探讨

2
00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:04,089
to define utility in infinitely repeated
无限重复地定义效用

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,649
games so remember that the way that an
游戏，所以请记住

4
00:00:08,849 --> 00:00:10,780
infinitely repeated game works is that
无限重复的游戏作品是

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,700
we have some stage game which is a
我们有一些舞台游戏

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,760
normal form game and the players
普通形式的游戏和玩家

7
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,620
repeatedly played this same game over
反复玩过同一游戏

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,019
and over again and what that means is
一遍又一遍，这意味着

9
00:00:20,219 --> 00:00:23,909
each player gets a sequence of payoffs
每个玩家都有一系列的回报

10
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,829
let's say player AI gets the sequence
假设玩家AI获得了序列

11
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,109
are one in the first repetition are two
在第一次重复中是两个

12
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:31,870
in the second repetition are three just
在第二次重复中，三个

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,820
on and on infinitely so we have this
持续不断，所以我们有这个

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,219
infinite sequence of real values which
实数的无限序列

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,928
are the payoffs that this player has
是该玩家的收益

16
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:40,059
gotten but if we want to reason about
得到了，但如果我们想推理一下

17
00:00:40,259 --> 00:00:41,919
this game we can't really reason using
这个游戏我们真的不能使用

18
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:43,599
utility theory of an infinite sequence
无限序列的效用理论

19
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,969
we instead have to take this sequence
相反，我们必须按照这个顺序

20
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,559
and turn it into a single number that
并将其转换为一个数字

21
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:49,959
talks about the utility that the player
谈论播放器的实用程序

22
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:52,140
has for having played this sequence and
已经玩过这个顺序了

23
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,969
so how do we do that what's the right
那么我们该怎么做才是正确的

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,239
way of thinking about that so the first
这样思考的方式，所以第一个

25
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,099
thing to notice is that previous things
需要注意的是以前的事情

26
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,719
that we've learned about game theory
我们已经了解了博弈论

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,070
aren't going to be sufficient to answer
不足以回答

28
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,289
this question so you might wonder if we
这个问题，所以您可能想知道我们是否

29
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,000
can take this infinitely repeated game
可以参加这个无限重复的游戏

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,250
and just write it an extensive form and
然后将其写成广泛的形式

31
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,590
of course we can't and the reason is
我们当然不能，原因是

32
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:13,869
that the extensive form would be
广泛的形式是

33
00:01:14,069 --> 00:01:15,759
infinitely deep we would never get to a
无限深，我们将永远不会

34
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:17,349
leaf node where we could write a payoff
我们可以写收益的叶节点

35
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:21,039
and so that won't help us you might also
这样对我们没有帮助，您可能也

36
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:23,049
just wonder can we sum up the sequence
只是想知道我们可以总结一下顺序

37
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,509
of payoffs and just say that my utility
回报，只是说我的效用

38
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:29,319
is the the sum of these values and the
是这些值的总和

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,609
problem is that that some can be
问题是，有些可以

40
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:33,459
unbounded because if for example every
无界的，因为例如

41
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:35,500
payoff I get is positive then I'm gonna
我得到的回报是正数，那么我要

42
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,679
have some unbounded amount of utility at
拥有无限的效用

43
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,329
the end and so that that's not going to
结束，所以这不会

44
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,590
work for me I want to have finite
为我工作我想要有限

45
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,609
utilities so instead there are two
实用程序，所以有两个

46
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,319
canonical ways that this gets defined
定义的规范方法

47
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,819
and I'll tell you about both of them in
我会在这件事上告诉你

48
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:52,119
this video so here's the first one so
这个视频，所以这是第一个

49
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,009
the first thing says let me look
第一件事说让我看

50
00:01:54,209 --> 00:01:56,409
intuitively at my average payoff over
凭直觉，我的平均收益超过

51
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:59,349
this sequence now the average payoff of
现在这个序列的平均收益为

52
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:00,730
a sequence is also not well-defined
序列也没有明确定义

53
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,829
because of course the way I take your
因为我当然以你的方式

54
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,750
average is I sum everything up and then
平均来说，我把所有东西都加起来

55
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,459
I divide it by the number of things and
我将其除以事物的数量， 

56
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,320
we've already seen that this sum can be
我们已经看到，这笔款项可以是

57
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,910
unbounded the number of things is
事物的数量是无限的

58
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,560
unbounded as well so I would have
无界的，所以我会

59
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,469
infinity divided
无限除

60
00:02:12,669 --> 00:02:14,000
infinity which wouldn't help me out here
无穷无尽，这对我没有帮助

61
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:16,640
but what I can do instead is to look at
但我能做的就是看

62
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,530
the limit of finite averages as the
有限平均数的极限为

63
00:02:18,729 --> 00:02:20,570
averages get longer and longer so what I
平均数越来越长，所以我

64
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:23,000
can say is let me look at an average
可以说是让我看一个平均值

65
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,850
over the first K things in my sequence
在我序列中的前K个事物中

66
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,670
and then let me take the limit of this
然后让我限制一下

67
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:32,270
average as K goes to infinity and it
当K达到无穷大时，它的平均值

68
00:02:32,469 --> 00:02:33,920
turns out actually technically this
实际上从技术上证明了这一点

69
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,780
isn't always well-defined it's almost
并不总是很明确，几乎

70
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:37,280
always well-defined and there's an easy
总是定义明确，并且很容易

71
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,539
fix that we can do to this definition
修正我们可以对此定义进行的操作

72
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:40,819
that I've left out here to keep it from
我已经留在这里，以防止它

73
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:43,130
getting too technical but in cases where
变得过于技术化，但在某些情况下

74
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,060
this is well-defined
这是明确的

75
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:47,360
this is the right thing to do so and and
这是正确的做法，并且

76
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,350
everything we'll talk about in this
我们将在此谈论的一切

77
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,569
course it'll be well-defined so so this
当然，它会被很好地定义，所以这

78
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:52,700
is the defined as the average reward
被定义为平均奖励

79
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:54,230
that the planner gets over the infinite
计划者克服了无限

80
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:56,590
sequence and this gives us one number
序列，这给了我们一个数字

81
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:58,580
the reason we have a second definition
我们有第二个定义的原因

82
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,830
is that there's something kind of
是某种东西

83
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,060
counterintuitive about the average
关于平均数的直觉

84
00:03:02,259 --> 00:03:05,000
reward let me put it back up the reason
奖励让我把它备份的原因

85
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,349
that it's kind of counterintuitive is
这有点违反直觉的是

86
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:09,980
that if I get some bad payoff for a
如果我得到了一些不好的回报

87
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,480
finite amount of time let's say for the
有限的时间让我们说

88
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,460
first hundred thousand iterations I get
我得到的前十万次迭代

89
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:15,939
a payoff of negative a million and then
负一百万的回报，然后

90
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:18,560
for the rest of time after that I get
在那之后的剩余时间里

91
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:21,439
some good payoff let's say one unit of
可以说一个好回报

92
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,930
utility then the limit of the means
效用然后是手段的极限

93
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:28,759
would be one because the the negative
将会是一个，因为负面的

94
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,110
payoff that I got at the beginning was
我一开始得到的回报是

95
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,879
only for a finite amount of time and it
只在有限的时间内

96
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,650
washes out in the average if I go long
如果我走多久，平均会被洗掉

97
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:36,319
enough out into the future and well
足够远的将来

98
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:37,909
that's what the math says but that
这就是数学所说的，但是

99
00:03:38,109 --> 00:03:39,950
doesn't always model what we want to to
并不总是为我们想要的模型

100
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,360
really reason about because we have an
真正原因是因为我们有一个

101
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,659
intuition that payoffs that you get it
直觉使你得到回报

102
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:46,460
early on are kind of more important than
早于比

103
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,259
payoffs that you get really far into the
您获得的收益确实很大

104
00:03:48,459 --> 00:03:50,750
future so if we want to have a model of
未来，所以如果我们想要一个模型

105
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:52,969
utility that has that property we need
具有我们需要的属性的实用程序

106
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,310
to say that different payoffs matter
说不同的收益很重要

107
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:58,520
differently so it's more important to me
不同，所以对我来说更重要

108
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:00,650
to get a good payoff in the first
在第一时间获得良好的回报

109
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:02,420
iteration than to get one in the
迭代比获得之一

110
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,520
millionth iteration and the way that I
第百万次迭代以及我的方式

111
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,830
can model that is by saying my payoffs
可以通过说我的收益来建模

112
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,379
are multiplied by some discount factor
乘以一些折扣系数

113
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:12,050
so my discount factor talks about my
所以我的折扣因素是关于我的

114
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,960
value for payoffs at different times so
在不同时间的回报价值

115
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:17,778
my discount factor beta is some value
我的折现系数beta有一定价值

116
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:21,199
strictly between 0 & 1 and you can sort
严格在0和1之间，您可以排序

117
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,338
of think of it like an interest rate
想像是利率

118
00:04:22,538 --> 00:04:26,000
it's saying you know with money if
就是说你知道有钱

119
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,000
I wanted to tell somebody that I'm gonna
我想告诉某人我要

120
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,930
pay them a hundred dollars in a year
一年付一百美元

121
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:35,090
they would value that at less than a
他们会认为该价格低于

122
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,770
hundred dollars today and so and the
今天一百美元等等

123
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,389
amount by which they would value it less
他们将其贬值的金额

124
00:04:41,589 --> 00:04:43,040
today kind of corresponds to the
今天的对应于

125
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,439
interest rate and that's kind of exactly
利率，这恰好是

126
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,180
what's going on in the math here so what
数学在这里发生了什么

127
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:50,420
I'm saying here is that my utility for
我是说我的工具

128
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,270
this stream of payoffs this stream of
这股回报之流

129
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,090
ours the stream of payoffs is weighted
我们的收益流是加权的

130
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,930
by the discount factor ^ which path in
通过折现因子^哪条路径

131
00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:02,980
the sequence it is so I'm going to
这是顺序，所以我要

132
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:06,980
discount each payoff successively so the
依次贴现每个收益，因此

133
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,790
first one it's going to have the
第一个将有

134
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,100
discount factor applied once the second
每秒应用一次折扣系数

135
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,420
one is going to have the discount factor
一个将有折扣因素

136
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,800
applied twice so I'm going to get the
申请了两次，所以我要去

137
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,199
discount factor squared and so on all
折扣系数平方等

138
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,790
the way through the sequence so each of
通过序列的方式，所以每个

139
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:18,410
them is going to be diminished but each
他们将减少，但每个
