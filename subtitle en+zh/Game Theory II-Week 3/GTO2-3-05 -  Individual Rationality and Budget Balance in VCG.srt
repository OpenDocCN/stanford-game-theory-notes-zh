prove it we begin by saying

281
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:56,279
pretty direct proof so as before let's

282
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,228
assume truth-telling an equilibrium and

283
00:11:58,428 --> 00:12:00,418
now what we want to think about is the

284
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:02,578
sum of transfers that agents make to the

285
00:12:02,778 --> 00:12:05,038
center so the sum of all of the payments

286
00:12:05,239 --> 00:12:07,348
and I want to show that the sum of all

287
00:12:07,548 --> 00:12:08,698
of these payments is greater than or

288
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:11,668
equal to zero that's going to mean week

289
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:14,818
budget balance so once again this is the

290
00:12:15,019 --> 00:12:17,068
VCG payment function and now I'm just

291
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:18,659
summing the payment function across all

292
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,488
of the agents because I'm interested in

the aggregate payment from the no single

they have for a world for the choice

them that gets made when I is dropped is

300
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:41,848
at least as big as the sum over all of

00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:53,968
these are exactly the terms that I have

in the VCG payment function

309
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,349
which means that this expression up here

00:13:11,549 --> 00:13:14,799
is just positive for every eye and not

311
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,919
negative for every eye and so that gives

312
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,539
us what we want which is that this whole
