00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,870
would be made if we ignore die

168
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,449
going to be a non negative number so

173
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:27,710
with here and so we've got this

you get that as the direct utility and

180
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:47,370
then you get charged everybody's utility

this as the social cost of an individual

190
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,300
does that mean that means having I

pivotal mechanism are these BCG

215
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,729
mechanisms so when we have this basic

216
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:22,299
form the theorem tells us that truth is

218
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:26,709
that so we'll first go through this
那我们先来看看

219
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:27,789
theorem and then we'll talk about a

220
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,829
converse near-miss as basically if you

224
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,919
going to have to be a growth mechanism

225
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,809
so these mechanisms will be dominant

226
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:44,799
strategy and basically in this setting

00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,409
they will be the only dominant strategy

229
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,419
choices okay

230
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,179
so let's have a look at this so let's
让我们来看看这个，让我们

231
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:57,069
look at to try and see why this theorem

232
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:00,189
is true let's think of what i's problem
是真的，让我想想我的问题

233
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:02,979
is so what they're getting is they're
所以他们得到的是

234
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:05,649
getting this is their true utility VI
得到这个才是他们真正的工具VI 

235
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:07,809
and they're thinking about what they
他们在想他们

236
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:10,299
should announce right so I is choosing
应该宣布正确，所以我选择

237
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,669
what what function should I tell the

238
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,149
mechanism that I have in terms of my

239
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:18,009
utility function so that's going to

240
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,839
affect the outcome and it's going to
影响结果，它将

241
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:22,509
affect the price and this is their

242
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,069
overall utility so they want to choose

243
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:26,469
the announcement to maximize the utility
最大限度地发挥效用的公告

244
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:28,839
function so let's have a look at the
功能，让我们来看看

245
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,789
groves mechanism substitute in for this
格罗夫斯机制代替了这一点

246
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,429
and then see what people's incentives
然后看看人们的动机是什么

247
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:34,389
are in that world
在那个世界上

248
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,109
so under groves mechanism your payment
所以在格罗夫机制下您的付款

249
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:40,839
rule looks like this so it looks like an
规则看起来像这样，所以看起来像

250
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:43,089
H I minus the V hat and when we take the
 HI减去V帽，当我们拿

251
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:44,769
minus of the overall thing we end up
减去整体的结果

252
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:49,929
with this so uh there should be an I
有了这个，所以应该有一个我

253
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:53,349
here subscript I so when we look at that
我在这里下标，所以当我们看那个

254
00:10:53,549 --> 00:10:55,419
payment scheme the individual is
个人的付款方式

255
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,870
choosing this to maximize their overall
选择这个来最大化他们的整体

256
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:01,839
utility um so first of all notice that
实用程序，所以首先请注意

257
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:04,449
this thing does not depend on V hat I
这个东西不取决于我的帽子

258
00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:06,849
so maximizing net is equivalent to
所以最大化净额等于

259
00:11:07,049 --> 00:11:08,620
maximizing this when we ignore it okay
当我们忽略它时可以最大化它

260
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,319
so now we've boiled this problem down to
所以现在我们把这个问题归结为

261
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,729
solving this problem
解决这个问题

262
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:17,370
okay so maximize VI of the chosen
好吧，所以最大化所选VI 

263
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:19,269
alternative is a function of what you
替代的是你所要的功能

264
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,539
announce plus the other peopls announced
宣布加上宣布的其他人

265
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,909
utilities okay now one thing to notice
实用程序现在可以注意一件事

266
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,889
is this begins to look like you're just
这开始看起来像你只是

267
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,049
trying to maximize the overall sum of
试图使...的总和最大化

268
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,609
utilities where yours is the truthful
实用的实用工具

269
00:11:30,809 --> 00:11:33,370
and then everyone else's is what the
然后其他人的是

270
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,919
announced one is so I would like to
宣布一个，所以我想

271
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,589
choose a glute declaration which would

272
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:41,859
lead to lead the mechanism to pick an

273
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:44,289
outcome which is going to maximize this
结果将最大化

274
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,469
overall thing right so what you'd like
总体来说是正确的，所以您想要什么

275
00:11:47,669 --> 00:11:50,439
to do is choose a V hat I that will lead
要做的是选择我会领导的V型帽

276
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,120
the mechanism to make a choice which

277
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,759
solves this problem okay so if we go

278
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,109
back and look at this problem

279
00:11:56,309 --> 00:11:58,959
maximizing overall the V hat I is

280
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:01,809
equivalent to saying let's try and get

281
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:05,559
the mechanism to choose an X which will

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,979
maximizes this then that's certainly

295
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:40,659
then they'll be maximizing exactly the

296
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,889
function that you want them to be

298
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,679
a dominant strategy right so the girls

299
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,269
mechanism will choose X in a way that

303
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:59,740
so this is a a this deceivingly simple
