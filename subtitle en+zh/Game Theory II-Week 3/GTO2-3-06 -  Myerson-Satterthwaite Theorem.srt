buyers types are equally likely I'm

gonna sell only to the high type and my

expected utility is I'm gonna sell at a

the sellers value from a transaction in

164
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,030
this case is going to be plus P and then

minus the value of the seller which is 0

of 1 probability 1/2

176
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:00,119
with is an inefficiency right so even

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,110
though the sellers value is zero when

183
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:17,879
that's the basic inefficiency so we're

184
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,528
better off to set the high price in

185

terms of the seller and we get an

inefficient trade these don't trade even

though they should okay what about other

sort of forced the seller to somehow

00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,309
let me say a little bit about why the

there are some situations where you

me just go through one to make clear

247
00:09:53,539 --> 00:09:55,049
what's going on here suppose that we
这是怎么回事，假设我们

248
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,809
were in situation where the buyers value

251
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,919
so there's some level V and we know that

it always exchange it at a price of fee

258
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:25,469
gets V that's going to be strategy proof

268
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,419
going to be that this theorem is true

regardless of what distribution is it's

275
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:02,209
proof based on our example so buyers

in terms of efficient trade and so what

282
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:17,889
we can do is just go through the

conditions try to satisfy them and show

285
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:27,669
situations what I'm going to do is I'm
情况下我要做的是

286
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,159
going to show the proof for full budget

287
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,409
balance not weak budget balance so

288
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:34,269
that's gonna make the proof a little bit

easier it's gonna be very easy to extend

case where we don't require full budget

292
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,120
balance and so here what we're going to

293
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,189
have is trade should take place for all

294
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:49,899
the combinations except when the buyer

and seller values are point one and
卖方的价值是第一点

296
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:54,339
point nine and that the nice part about

that just in terms of notation is that

302
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,419

price as a function of what the buyer

you'll see we're quite easily that

313
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,769
that'll bound these things so the thing

we say Anna proof will work through for

317
00:12:40,278 --> 00:12:43,979
values are one in point nine so the the

320
00:12:49,289 --> 00:12:50,828
rationality of the seller and here we're

321
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:52,569
using ex-post individual rationality in

I'll do the ex post version again the

327
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,589
extension is fairly straightforward

328
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,240
you'll just be working with expected

329
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,839
payments instead of actual payments so

337
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:37,939

347
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,879
anything away so they can't be charged

354
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:18,799
do is we've got individuation how are

bridge of those two prices and it has to

be better than me pretending that I'm a

376
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,328
point nine type so alternatively I could

00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:15,649
pretend that I'm a point nine type

instead and these would be the prices I

379
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:23,000
would get okay so in that situation we

380
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,639
can ask and I have a no value for the
可以问，我没有任何价值

381
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,870
good so it doesn't really matter in

this case this turns out to be the

385
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:36,000
check what that implies so
检查这意味着什么

386
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,589
by one two and three we have bounds on
一二三

387
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:44,279
how low this price can be how high this
这个价格可以低到多少

389
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:48,599
this price is so we know that this one

390
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,750
this last one has to be zero we know

393
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:02,459
is at most point one and so in terms of
最多是第一点，因此

394
00:16:02,659 --> 00:16:05,370
an inequality we know that this over all

395
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:08,250
and multiplying through by the two p10

396
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,959
plus point one has to be greater than
加点必须大于

397
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,500
equal to 0.9 points plus zero okay so we
等于0.9点加零好，所以我们

398
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,689
can take what we know from one two and
可以从一二中得到我们所知道的

399
00:16:15,889 --> 00:16:18,269
three plug them in here on in terms of
三个将它们插入此处

400
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,620
bounds given that we have the inequality
假设我们有不等式

401
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,689
pointing from the left to the right and
从左到右指向

402
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:25,258
that tells us then that p10 has to be at
然后告诉我们p10必须位于

403
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,258
least point eight okay so in order to
至少要点八点好，这样才能

404
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:29,878
make sure that the seller doesn't want
确保卖方不想要

405
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:31,409
