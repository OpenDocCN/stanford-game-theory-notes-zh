the agents VCG payments let's look for

00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,488
be a hundred and fifty well we know that

two could coordinate to change their

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,060
how does that happen well it turns out

56
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:29,170
that agent to change of declaration

so we have to be sure that we don't use

65
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,670
VCG in situations where it's easy for

66
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,879
agents to collude so the next problem

00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,618
with VCG that I'd like to tell you about

68
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:00,009
is that the again has to do with the

69
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:02,740
payments and we say that VCG is not

frugal because the payments can can

71
00:03:05,068 --> 00:03:07,450
really see him out of line so let's

72
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,520
think again about this graph routing
再考虑一下这个图形路由

73
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,649
example that we've seen before where we
我们在之前看到的例子

74
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:13,569
want to find the shortest path and pay

75
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:15,520
agents for routing traffic along their
沿其路由流量的代理

76
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:18,159
edges so recall in this example that the
边缘，所以在此示例中回想起

77
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,280
shortest path is this one with a cost of
最短的路径是成本为

78
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:26,170
5 and recall also that the second
 5，还记得第二

79
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,750
shortest path is this one with a cost of
最短的路径是成本为

80
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:36,580
6 right 2 + 3 + 1 now let's think in
 6对2 + 3 + 1现在让我们思考

81
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:39,969
particular about the effect on agent a B
特别注意对试剂A B的影响

82
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:44,499
of changes to a C's cost and what I'm
 C的成本变化和我的变化

83
00:03:44,699 --> 00:03:47,200
going to end up showing you is that VCG
最终向您展示的是VCG 

84
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,140
can end up paying arbitrarily more than

85
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,640
a B is willing to accept because a B's
乙愿意接受，因为乙的

86
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,530
payment doesn't end up depending on his

87
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,300
own declaration but instead ends up

88
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,399
depending on on the cost of the next
取决于下一个的成本

89
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:06,659
shortest path so and this is also a
最短的路径，这也是

90
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:08,740
possible problem in cases where we're
在我们遇到的情况下可能出现的问题

91
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:10,300
not paying the agents were rather where
不向代理商付款，而是在哪里

92
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,340
the agents are paying us so let's see
代理商付钱给我们，让我们看看

93
00:04:12,539 --> 00:04:15,819
how it works so if for example the cost
它是如何工作的，例如成本

94
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:20,278
of this edge was to increase to 8 then
这个优势是增加到8 

95
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,629
here our cost would be 12
这里我们的成本是12 

96
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:27,209
our second shortest paths cost would be
我们的第二个最短路径成本是

97
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:30,528
12 and so that that would change the
 12，这样就可以改变

98
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:34,050
payment to a B and it would go up by six
支付给乙，它将增加六

99
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,759
so we increased this value here of
所以我们在这里增加了这个值

100
00:04:35,959 --> 00:04:37,879
somebody else's value by six and
别人的价值是六

101
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:40,439
although we didn't change anything about
虽然我们没有改变任何事情

102
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,749
what a B was willing to accept we ended
乙愿意接受什么，我们结束了

103
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,300
up changing our payment to a B also by
也将我们的付款更改为B 

104
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,230
sex and indeed if the cost was any X
性别，如果费用是X 

105
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,819
greater than to four for this edge AC
对于此边缘AC，大于四

106
00:04:53,019 --> 00:04:56,699
then we would end up making a payment to
那么我们最终将付款给

107
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:00,149
a B which depends on X and doesn't
一个B取决于X并且不依赖于

108
00:05:00,348 --> 00:05:02,490
depend on a B's own value so this means
取决于B自身的值，所以这意味着

109
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:04,499
that the gap between agents true costs
代理商之间的差距，真实成本

110
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:05,730
and the payments they could receive
以及他们可以收到的款项

111
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,259
under VCG is unbounded now we might
在VCG下是无界的，现在我们可能

112
00:05:10,459 --> 00:05:11,519
think that we're just comparing to the
认为我们只是在与

113
00:05:11,718 --> 00:05:14,160
wrong thing we might think that that we
错误的事情，我们可能会以为我们

114
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,959
really can't do anything about the fact
事实真的无能为力

115
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:18,838
that VCG is going to not be able to
 VCG将无法

116
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:20,550
charge people based on their own values
根据自己的价值观向人们收费

117
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,800
but we might hope that VC G's payments
但我们可能希望VC G的付款

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,449
are close to the cost of the second
接近第二次的成本

119
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:27,449
shortest disjoint path and it turns out
最短的不相交路径，结果

120
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:30,028
that that's not even true so here's a
那甚至都不是真的，所以这是一个

121
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:31,499
different a little bit more complicated
不同一点更复杂

122
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:34,350
graph that will illustrate that point so
可以说明这一点的图表

123
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,350
here I have two disjoint paths this one
这里我有两条不相交的路径

124
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:40,769
here goes through K agents and each
这里经过K个代理商，每个

125
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:44,819
agent has a cost of C over K so K times
代理商的成本超过K，所以K倍

126
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:48,499
C over K means the total cost is C here
 C超过K表示总成本为C 

127
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:52,379
I have another edge with only one agent
我只有一个代理人有另一个优势

128
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:55,800
and his cost is C times 1 plus Epsilon
他的成本是C乘以1加Epsilon 

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,259
so as long as Absalon is a positive
只要阿布萨隆是积极的

130
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,300
number the top path is going to be
编号的最高路径将是

131
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,110
shorter than the bottom path so VCG
比底部路径短，所以VCG 

132
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,629
picks the top path and it pays each of
选择顶部路径，并支付每个

133
00:06:06,829 --> 00:06:12,179
the K agents this amount here so it
 K代理商在这里的数量，所以它

134
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:15,449
charges each of the K agents the costs
向K个代理商收取费用

135
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,459
of the other agents on the shortest path
最短路径上其他代理的数量

136
00:06:17,658 --> 00:06:21,689
and then it pays them the utility there
然后向他们支付公用事业费

137
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:23,129
the cost of the guy who doesn't get
没有得到的人的代价

138

144
00:06:41,098 --> 00:06:43,660
kind of bad news because compare this

145
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,689
value here to this value and you'll see

second shortest path so it really seems

like VCG can end up paying much more

weakly increase as I add agents to the

mechanism so you might kind of

intuitively think that if I'm running a

the great properties that VCG has there

are also some caveats with it now I

caveats are problems with mechanisms

256
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:12,068
other than VCG as well so although I've

want to leave you with the impression

that these are problems only with BCG

260
00:11:16,428 --> 00:11:18,969
but in general these are things that one

261
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:20,529
should think about before making a

choice of mechanism
