begin with I'm going to start using this

27
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,259
have the notion of strict dominance and

here I'm going to say that si strictly

30
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:30,819
that for every other strategy profile of

37
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:53,829
prime I so in other words it might

38
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,840
matter to player i what everybody else

strictly happier because we have a

get strictly more utility by playing

definition as you will have noticed the

52
00:02:32,188 --> 00:02:33,730
only difference here is that I have a

weak inequality instead of a strict

54
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:37,959
inequality and so what this is saying is

00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,780
no matter what everybody else does I'm

always at least as happy playing si as I

am playing s Prime and when that's true

58
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:51,730
I say that si very weakly dominates as

59
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,300
Prime I now you might wonder why I have

60
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,149
this name very weak that's because this

61
00:02:58,348 --> 00:03:00,789
condition even allows for equality so

even if it's the case that si and s

64
00:03:05,938 --> 00:03:08,080
each other I'm still allowed to say that

65
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,618
si si Prime and that sounds like a

66
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:13,480
strong thing to say about equality so we

soften it by saying it's very weak

us right now so I won't mention them

think about what the other agents are

worse by playing si so regardless of the

kind of dominance it's sort of a good

dominates something but I can say that

playing a dominant strategy has to be a
发挥主导策略必须是

105
00:04:54,689 --> 00:04:57,430
Nash equilibrium so if everyone is

106
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,620
playing a dominant strategy then we've
扮演主导策略，那么我们已经

107
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,389
just got a Nash equilibrium because none

113
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,900
strategies then this equilibrium has got

114
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,560
to be unique because there can't be two

116
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:21,100
strategies because that would mean we

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,990
prefer these strategies to each other

119
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:29,050
lastly I want to think about the

120
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,600
prisoner's dilemma game and I want to

121
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,490
argue to you that the players have a
跟你争辩说球员有一个

122
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:38,230
dominant strategy in this game so I want

123
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,150
to claim to you that player one has the
声称您拥有一个玩家

124

125
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,370
going to do this by a case analysis so
通过案例分析来做到这一点

126
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:47,050
let's begin by considering the case
让我们从考虑情况开始

127
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,800
where player 2 plays see if player 2

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,800
plays C then player 1 is really thinking
玩C，那么玩家1真的在想

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,028
about this column of the matrix he knows

130
00:05:58,228 --> 00:06:00,338
he's in this column and that means he

133
00:06:06,348 --> 00:06:10,210
0 is bigger than minus 1 and so player 1
 0比负1大，因此玩家1 

134
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,430
would prefer to get 0 which means that
宁愿得到0，这意味着

the other hand let's consider the case
另一方面让我们考虑一下情况

137
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,100
where player 2 is playing D in this case

player 1 finds himself in this green
