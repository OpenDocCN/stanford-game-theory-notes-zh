1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:03,188
let us now look at some examples and of
现在让我们来看一些例子

2
00:00:03,388 --> 00:00:07,609
games and Nash equilibria in those games
游戏和那些游戏中的纳什均衡

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,390
so here's the first game a familiar game
所以这是第一个熟悉的游戏

4
00:00:10,589 --> 00:00:14,189
this is of course the prisoner's dilemma
这当然是囚犯的困境

5
00:00:14,388 --> 00:00:18,190
the if both prisoners cooperate and
如果两个囚犯合作， 

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,859
content and then they get a light
内容，然后他们就亮了

7
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:25,568
punishment and if they do not cooperate
惩罚，如果他们不配合

8
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:28,839
they get a more severe punishment if the
他们会受到更严厉的惩罚

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,550
one cooperates and the others does not
一个合作而其他不合作

10
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,309
then the co-op irrigated terrible
然后合作社灌溉很糟糕

11
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,608
punishment and the one that does not
惩罚与不惩罚

12
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:38,500
cooperate gets off scot it gets off
合作下车苏格兰人下车

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,378
scot-free and of course this game has a
无苏格兰人，当然这个游戏有

14
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:45,038
dominant strategy to defect no matter
主导缺陷策略无论如何

15
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:47,649
what the other agent does you're better
另一个代理商你做得更好

16
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,570
off not cooperating and so of course the
不合作，所以当然

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,018
only dominant strategy outcome is this
唯一的主要策略结果是

18
00:00:56,219 --> 00:00:58,689
one of both defecting and indeed that is
既有缺陷，又有缺陷的是

19
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:00,788
the only Nash equilibrium in this game
这场比赛中唯一的纳什均衡

20
00:01:00,988 --> 00:01:03,729
so it's the Nash equilibrium it's the
所以这是纳什均衡

21
00:01:03,929 --> 00:01:05,560
best response if the other person
如果对方最佳反应

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,659
defects then it's the best respond to
缺陷，那么它是最好的应对方法

23
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,969
defect but in fact it's much stronger
缺陷，但实际上要强大得多

24
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,709
than that it's best to defect no matter
最好不要有任何缺点

25
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,890
what the other the other agent does so
另一个代理人这样做

26
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:17,439
this is an example of one unique Nash
这是一个独特的纳什的例子

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,090
equilibrium that happened to be very
恰好是非常均衡

28
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:21,278
strong one a dominant strategy Nash
强势策略Nash 

29
00:01:21,478 --> 00:01:25,659
equilibrium so so here's another game
平衡，所以这是另一个游戏

30
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:27,549
this is the game of pure coordination I
这是纯粹协调的游戏

31
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,299
think of it as walking towards each

32
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,789
other on the sidewalk and you both can

33
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,950
decide whether to go to your respective
决定是否去你各自的

34
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,769
lifts or respective rights in both cases

35
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:43,659
you will do fine and you will not
你会做得很好，你不会

36
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:45,549
collide and of course if you miss
碰撞，当然，如果您想念

37
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,619
coordinate if you one goes to the left
协调，如果你去左边

38
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:48,609
and the other to the right you will
另一个在右边

39
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,628
collide so this is a natural game and in
碰撞，所以这是自然的游戏

40
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:55,359
fact you see that you have two Nash
事实上你看到你有两个纳什

41
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,028
equilibria the one that I wrote down

42
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:01,869
here if one one of the players goes to

44
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:06,609
the left and conversely if the other

player goes to the right you're best off

46
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,838
going to the right as well and the
也会向右走， 

47
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,550
others are not Nash equilibria so here's
其他人不是纳什均衡，所以这里的

48
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,090
an exam

discuss why we call these pure strategy

53
00:02:26,128 --> 00:02:31,110
later on here's a very different game

here let's think about it suppose I pick

head what is your best response well

your best response then is to pick tails

00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,540
response is not to play tail because I

want to coordinate with you because then

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,528
match so we have this cycle where the

00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:07,230
best responses are leading us in the

126
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,800
cycle and so there is no pure strategy
