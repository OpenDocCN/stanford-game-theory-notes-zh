so far we've thought about some

we've thought about how to play them but

so in a sense the the problem of

there's a way that I can identify

there's some outcome Oh which is at

64
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:58,509
be so so they let me actually make an
是这样，所以他们让我实际上

65
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:01,810
example of this so Oh might be that

66
00:03:02,009 --> 00:03:05,379
player one gets seven units of utility

least as good for everybody and it's
至少对每个人都一样，这是

72
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,450
because it's equal for player one and

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,960
this case it seems reasonable to say

that an outside observer should feel

that outcome oh is better than outcome

79
00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:45,969
this is that outcome Oh purrito
这就是那个结果哦purrito 

80
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:52,420
dominates Oh prime well now I can define

81
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,868
this concept of Pareto optimality an
帕累托最优的概念

82
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:59,770
outcome Oh star is purrito optimal if it
结果如果它是星形的，那么星形是最优的

83
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:03,069
isn't purrito dominated by anything so
并不是purrito主导任何事情

84
00:04:03,269 --> 00:04:05,500
but that's kind of a hard definition
但这有点很难定义

85
00:04:05,699 --> 00:04:07,180
because it's defined in negative terms
因为它是负面定义

86
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,879
let me say it again an outcome Oh star
让我再说一遍结果哦，明星

87
00:04:10,079 --> 00:04:20,889
is pretty optimistic and so let's test
非常乐观，所以让我们测试

88
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,959
our understanding of this definition by

89
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:24,879
asking a couple of questions

00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:27,699
is it possible for a game to have more

91
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:29,939
than one Pareto optimal outcome as
比一个帕累托最优结果

92
00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:31,749
always let me encourage you to think

93
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:33,759
about this for a second before I answer
在我回答之前大约一秒钟

94
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:40,269
it of course it is because it's possible

for two outcomes

00:04:41,968 --> 00:04:44,619
- neither predominate each other if for

97
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:46,989
example all payoffs in the game are the

98
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:50,050
same if I have a game where everyone

happens then

101
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,269
nothing dominates anything else because

105
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,910
optimal outcome something else I can ask

is does every game have at least one

Pareto optimal outcome or is it possible

108
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:14,160
that just nothing will be fredo optimal

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,980
well well let you think about it for a

110
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,699
second but the answer is yes every game

111
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:23,649
has to have at least one Pareto optimal

112
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:30,069
outcome this is easy to see because in

113
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:32,559
order for something to not be pre to

we would need to have a cycle in pre

dough dominance we would need to have it

125
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,139
dominance is defined that in order for

126
00:06:05,338 --> 00:06:06,429
something to be pretty to dominate it

I'll leave this to you to think about

130
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:15,160
but but that definition implies that

there can't be cycles in the period or

133
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,350
look at our example games that we've

134
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,420
thought about and identify preeto
