18
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,189
should I do in response so these are the

00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:03,459
take a look um so how would we can

we're just working through heuristic

40
00:01:35,459 --> 00:01:37,569
aliy we'll get to formal definitions and

00:01:37,769 --> 00:01:40,000
analysis in a little bit but let's just

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,459
go through the basic reasoning now ok so

player should be no more than 67 right

49
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,128
so if I think that everybody's rational

50
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,918
I so if I believe that's true then I

51
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:05,619
think that nobody should be naming an

52
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:09,160
integer bigger than 67 ok so what what

53
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,699
does that mean
这是否意味着

54
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:11,320
well that means that I can't think that

the average is any higher than 67 right

56
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,530
so if the average ex is no bigger than

57
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:21,070
67 then I should be naming no more than

58
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:23,920
two-thirds of 67 right now you can begin

59
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,310
to see where this is going so that means

65
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:39,160
67 we keep going on this so nobody

should be naming anything more than

bit lower than everybody else's guests

the way down to a to announcing one and

85
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:24,340
higher than the average guest so I

86
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:26,770
wouldn't be at two-thirds of the mean so

00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:29,410
this is going to be a stable point okay

104
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:13,000
have integers going from 0 to 100 and
具有从0到100的整数，并且

105
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,879
then over here we have the frequency so

how many people name to give an integer

107
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,180
so the 50 right here is the the mode so

108
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,990
we get the mode of 50 the most often

named integer was

they haven't gone through all the

114
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,250
of this game is what's the mean here so

00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,620
the mean was 34 so actually there's some

interesting things you some people

be better off

124
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:04,150
up looking through this what we end up

138
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,240
see another spike at two-thirds of 33 so

of people are going to think that the

00:05:54,569 --> 00:05:56,829
winner in this game was the winner was

146
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:59,560
actually 23 so two-thirds of the average

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,759
guess here was about 23 the mean was was

34 and so one of these people randomly

00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:08,470
would end up being the winner of this

00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,530
game okay um there's actually a spike of

00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,509
people who went all the way to the Nash

you really believe that everybody else

is going to name the integer one then

00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:25,750
that's your best response but in

situations where a bunch of people don't

00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:30,340
haven't reasoned through it then you

actually would be better off naming a

161
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:35,009
higher number so Nash equilibrium is a

162
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:37,718
stable point if everybody figures it out

best thing you can do

necessarily playing the Nash equilibrium
