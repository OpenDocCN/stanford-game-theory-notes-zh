this video will explain to you the
该视频将向您说明

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,428
intuition behind a new game theoretic

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:05,710
solution concept called correlated

4
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,910
equilibrium let's think again about the
平衡让我们再考虑一下

5
00:00:10,109 --> 00:00:12,550
battle of the sexes game and let's think
两性游戏之战，让我们想一想

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,559
about its Nash equilibria remember
关于它的纳什均衡记得

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,060
there's a Nash equilibrium where both
纳什均衡

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,609
players play B there's a Nash
玩家玩B有纳什

9
00:00:18,809 --> 00:00:20,440
equilibrium where both players play F
双方都发挥F的平衡

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,210
and there's another Nash equilibrium
还有另一个纳什均衡

11
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,010
where both players randomize according
两位玩家根据

12
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,760
to these probabilities and that means
这些概率，这意味着

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,709
that all four of the outcomes can happen
所有四个结果都可能发生

14
00:00:32,909 --> 00:00:35,619
so both of these outcomes can happen but
所以这两种结果都可能发生，但是

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,669
these ones can happen as well now let's
这些事情也可以发生现在，让我们

16
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:41,709
think about intuitively what makes the
直觉地思考什么使

17
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,419
most sense to us about the battle of the
对我们而言，最了解

18
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:46,689
sexes it's really that this outcome
性别确实是这个结果

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,628
would happen half the time and this
会发生一半的时间，这

20
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:52,059
outcome would happen half the time all
结果会一半都发生

21
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:53,529
right if you and your partner really did

22
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,239
have different preferences about what to

23
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:57,459
do and you wanted to be together you

24
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,140
would work it out where you each win

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,959
half the time and something that might

26
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:03,158
have struck you about battle of the

27
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,899
sexes is it doesn't give us a way to say
性别是没有给我们一种表达方式

28
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,879
that that's a stable outcome and the
那是一个稳定的结果， 

29
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:08,619
reason why we don't say it's stable is
我们不说它稳定的原因是

30
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,039
that if both of these things can happen

31
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,469
then both players have to be playing

32
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,329
mixed strategies with full support and

33
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,609
that means the MIS coordination actions

34
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:24,129
have to be possible as well well here's

35
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:25,569
another example that we can think about
我们可以考虑的另一个例子

36
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:27,099
there will give us some intuition for

37
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,000
why the what's really going on here and

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,128
how we can do something about it so this

39
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:35,259
is the traffic game so this models the

situation where two cars are coming

41

42
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:40,179
have to decide whether to wait for the

one of them goes and the other one waits

46
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,009
then the one that goes gets the most

47
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:52,689
utility and the one that waits gets a

48
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,179
bit less utility if they both wait

53
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:08,618
crash into each other so in total we

54
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,840
have two pure strategy equilibria that

133
00:05:05,089 --> 00:05:07,050
it can get us these kinds of nice fair
