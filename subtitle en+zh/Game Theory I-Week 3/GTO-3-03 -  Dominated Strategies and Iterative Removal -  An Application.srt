4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,519
dominated strategies has any bite in

5
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:16,030
application and in order to do this
应用程序并为此

6
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,820
we're gonna look at an experiment that

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,550
was done by Baldwin and Meese in the
由Baldwin和Meese在

8

late 1970s and they were actually
 1970年代后期，实际上

9
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:26,079
looking at social behavior in pigs so

10
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:28,419
this the players in our game here are

11
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,409
going to be pigs and there's actually a

12
00:00:32,609 --> 00:00:33,579
sort of an interesting discussion of

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,439
this this comes from Joe Harrington's
这是乔·哈灵顿的

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,709
book game strategies and decision-making

15
00:00:37,909 --> 00:00:43,439
and the idea is sort of interesting
这个想法很有意思

16
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,479
you've got two pigs in a cage okay so

17
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,649
they're in a cage several meter caged

18
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:52,659
one of the pigs is larger than the other

19
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:55,358
we call that the dominant Pig or I mean

20
00:00:55,558 --> 00:00:57,640
well sorry for the terminology so what
不好意思，所以该怎么办

21
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,928
we'll actually use the word larger Pig

22
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:06,759
and in what they need to do is is food
他们需要做的就是食物

23
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:08,349
arrives but they need to press a lever

24
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:11,109
to get the food to arrive okay and the
拿到食物就可以了

25
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,019
critical thing is that the lever is on

26
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:16,119
one side of the cage you go over you

27
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:18,879
press the lever and then the food

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,590
okay so the pigs are put in a cage the
好吧，所以把猪放在笼子里

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,509
cage they learn eventually that if they
笼子里，他们最终了解到，如果他们

31
00:01:25,709 --> 00:01:27,640
hit this lever food appears on the other
打这个杠杆食物出现在另一个

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,819
side so what they would have to do is if

33
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:32,319
they want to eat they would have to move

34
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,939
over a run up to one side of the cage

35
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,278
hit the lever run back to the other side

36
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:38,558
get the food that comes out eat the food

37
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,569
a few pellets of food then they go back

40
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,698
okay now the difficult part is that
好吧，现在困难的部分是

41
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,399
there are two pigs in the cage so if we
笼子里有两只猪，所以如果我们

42
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:54,939
put two pigs in the same cage and one is

43
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,909
larger than when they're both trying to

44
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:00,399
get the food which comes out and and

45
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:03,069
these are pigs the larger one will end

46
00:02:03,269 --> 00:02:06,730
up getting the food and the smaller one

47
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,770
will get less food okay so that's the
会减少食物的摄入量，所以这就是

48
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:10,600
basic idea here and then we can analyze
这里的基本思想，然后我们可以分析

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,819
this as a game
这是一个游戏

50
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:14,410
so in particular let's take a look in
所以特别让我们来看看

51
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:16,149
more detail at how the payoffs work here
有关收益如何工作的更多详细信息

52
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:18,730
so when the food comes out there's 10
所以当食物出来的时候有十个

53
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,099
units of food and say pellets of food
食物单位并说食物颗粒

54
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:24,160
that come out and let's look at what the
出来，让我们看看

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,520
typical split ends up being if there are
典型的分裂最终是如果有

56
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:30,129
two pigs in the cage one it's larger one

57
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:33,219
smaller and if the larger one gets to

58
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,789
the food first then there's basically a
首先是食物，然后基本上是

59
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:40,090
1 9 split so that means that the small
 1 9分裂意味着小

60
00:02:40,289 --> 00:02:41,530
pig ends up with just with one pellet
猪只剩下一粒

61
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,349
and the larger pig would end up with 9
而较大的猪最终会得到9 

62
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,030
units of the food so if the large one
食物的单位，所以如果大一个

63
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,469
gets there first it's very hard for the

64
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,719
small one to get anything they tend to

65
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:54,730
get one on average but not close to

66
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,429
nothing if the small Pig gets to the

67
00:02:57,628 --> 00:03:00,129
food first then they end up with a 4 6
食物，然后他们最终得到4 6 

68
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:04,030
split ok so then it's 40 60 so the small
好的，然后是40 60那么小

69
00:03:04,229 --> 00:03:05,709
pig still gets less the the bigger
猪仍然变得越来越少

70
00:03:05,908 --> 00:03:08,170
people gets more but the small Pig at

71
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,270
least has a literally a fighting chance

73
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,099
same time then it's a 3 7 split so the

74
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:22,270
bigger Pig gets the little more and one

75
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:23,860
other thing is that you know running

76
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,659
over and pressing the lever actually

77
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,789
consume some calories so let's take that

78
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:30,670
they take it to say two units of food in

79
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,219
terms of energy ok so so we've got these

80
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,469
different splits and so forth so what we
不同的分裂等等，所以我们

81
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:38,890
can do is write out a simple normal form

82
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,399
game for that so given all these numbers

83
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,460
here's the small pig over here large pig

other Pig to press the lever
其他猪按下操纵杆

89
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,610
now if you both go to press the lever
现在，如果你们两个都去按操纵杆

90
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:02,590
then they get back to the food at the
然后他们回到那里的食物

91

92
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:06,819
split but it's a three seven split and
拆分，但这是三七拆分， 

93
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:09,340
then you subtract off two for the cost
然后你减去两个

94
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:11,740
of running back and forth so they each
来回奔跑，所以他们每个人

95
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:15,460
lose two units of food so three minus
失去两份食物，所以减去三分

96
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,959
two we get the 1 7 minus 2 we get the 5
两个我们得到1 7减去2我们得到5 

97
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:24,250
so we end up with 1 5 if they both do it
因此，如果他们俩都这样做，我们最终得到1 5 

98
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:26,170
at the same time
与此同时

99
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,439
in a situation where say the small pig
在说小猪的情况下

100
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:32,410
presses the lever and the big pig just
按下杠杆和大猪只是

101
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,990
waits there then it's a 1 9 split but
等那里然后是1 9拆分，但是

102
00:04:35,189 --> 00:04:37,360
the small pig ends up losing two units
小猪最终损失了两个单位

103
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,829
and energy they actually end up with a
和能量，他们实际上最终以

104
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:41,199
net negative in that situation and so
在那种情况下净负

105
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:42,879
forth so you can go through and put this
出来，所以你可以通过并把这个

106
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:44,889
into a normal form game what we end up
变成普通形式的游戏，我们最终会得到什么

107
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:48,310
with is a simple matrix form 2x2 game
与是一个简单的矩阵形式的2x2游戏

108
00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:51,819
which looks like this okay so we can

109
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,829
analyze this game quite simply let's

110
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:56,020
take it and let's say I analyze it via

111
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,129
the iterative elimination of strictly
严格的迭代消除

112
00:04:57,329 --> 00:04:59,560
dominated strategies so what's true in

113
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,590
this game well where does anybody have a
这个游戏很好，有人在哪里

114
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,439
strictly dominated strategy the big pig
严格控制策略的大猪

115
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,300
the large Pig doesn't have a strictly
大猪没有严格

116
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,680
dominated strategy they would like to
他们想主导的策略

117
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,110
wait if the other one presses they would

118
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,960
prefer to press if the other one waits
如果对方等待，则喜欢按

119
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,910
so no domination here but notice that
所以这里没有统治，但要注意

120
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:21,819
the small pig always gets a higher

121
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:26,319
payoff for versus 1 0 versus minus 1

122
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:30,610
they would always prefer to wait so in
他们总是喜欢等

123
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,840
this particular situation the small Pig
这种特殊情况的小猪

124
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,730
has a strictly dominated strategy of
有严格的策略

125
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:40,420
waiting so we should get rid of press as

126
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,560
a strategy for the small Pig and once

127
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,189
we've done that now in what's left the
我们现在在剩下的

128
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,100
Big Pig should press and so what we end
大猪应该压，所以我们要结束

129
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,270
up with is when we iteratively eliminate
与我们迭代消除时

130
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:57,819
strictly dominated strategies we end up

131
00:05:58,019 --> 00:05:59,860
with a prediction that the small pig

132
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,009
should wait and the big pig should be

133
00:06:03,209 --> 00:06:07,150
the one that presses the lever okay so

134
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:09,579
let's look at how they actually behaved
让我们看看他们的实际表现

135
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,340
the pigs in there in the experiment and
实验中的猪

136
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,079
so what they did here is they gave him
