2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:04,569
looking at Nash equilibrium and

understanding play and in settings where

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,979
we make those kinds of predictions and

5
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:10,510
we've also been looking a little bit at

6
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,809
dominance relationships and and now

7
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:16,419
let's talk about strictly dominated

strategies and iterative removal of

9
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,260
those which is another way to analyze a

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,810
game so you know when you when you're

11
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:24,129
talking about game theory there's many

12
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:25,960
different ways that people can think

15
00:00:33,058 --> 00:00:35,320
people are going to do what logic can be

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,029
applied and this is another important

17
00:00:40,229 --> 00:00:41,739
way of looking at games and they give us

18
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:45,820
some insights so the idea of when we

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,919
start thinking about rationality in game

20
00:00:48,119 --> 00:00:49,659
theory that the basic premise here has

21
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:51,878
been that players maximize their payoff
玩家获得最大回报

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,858
so they're basically trying to maximize

23
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:55,689
their payoffs and again it doesn't

24
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,559
necessarily mean that they're just

25
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,390
greedy payoffs could be that they you

26
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:01,509
know they are altruistic public-minded

27
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,388
etc but the the premise here is that

28
00:01:04,588 --> 00:01:06,399
there's something some objective

29
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:09,219
function that people have and they tend

31
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,250
payoffs rather than lay out lower

32
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:16,988
payoffs okay so in terms of iteration on

33
00:01:17,188 --> 00:01:18,340
this logic what we're going to be
这种逻辑，我们将成为

34
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,079
thinking about is what if all players

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,789
know that other players maximize their

36
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:23,619
payoffs and we have an idea of what the

37
00:01:23,819 --> 00:01:25,299
structure of the game is then what does

38
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,549
that mean for the game can can we make

39
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,289
deduce something about what should be

played in the game and what if all

43
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,219
so you can you know take this what if I

44
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,929
know that you know that I know and and

45
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:42,609
and so forth you can take this ad

46
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,149
absurdum but it's an important concept

47
00:01:46,349 --> 00:01:49,090
and understanding what it yields gives

48
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,099
us some insight into games and gives us

49
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,069
some predictability now you know going

00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:55,750
through very very high levels of this

51
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:58,090
are questionable but nonetheless the

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,640
logic here and the predictions that are

53
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,859
made will give us some understanding of

games that we can use in analyzing

56
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:12,200
it so you know we can take this logic

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,170
fully two of to its full logic

58
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,770
conclusion okay so in terms of strictly

59
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:20,209
dominated strategies that means a

60
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:23,118
strategy which which is all there's some

61
00:02:23,318 --> 00:02:24,649
other strategy which always does better

62
00:02:24,848 --> 00:02:27,230
than it it can never be a best reply so

63
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,069
so we'll make that clear in a second so

64
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:33,289
basically that means that that if this

69
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,670
players then basically it's never going
玩家然后基本上永远不会

70
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,618
to be played so this is essentially a

71
00:02:45,818 --> 00:02:48,980
strategy we can just safely ignore if we

75
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,810
in all circumstances for them so we

76
00:02:57,009 --> 00:02:59,118
remove those from the game and the idea

77
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:01,099
of iteration is we take those out now

78
00:03:01,299 --> 00:03:03,140
we've got a simpler game now let's do

79
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,730
the same thing right so there might be

81
00:03:06,098 --> 00:03:07,879
dominated in this thing so a player

82
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,349
should never play this once we get to
一旦到达

83
00:03:09,549 --> 00:03:12,289
this reduced game and then we take those

84
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,599
out and we get an even further reduced

85
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:16,039
game and so forth

86
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,868
and we just keep iterating on that it

87
00:03:18,068 --> 00:03:19,789
leaves us with some prediction and then

88
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:21,259
we think that the only thing that's

89
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:23,360
logical if there's rational players and

they understand that other players are

92
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,849
be left inside that sub game okay so the

00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:34,249
running this process - its termination

95
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:42,319
of strictly dominated strategies so in

96
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,590
terms of formal notation what are we

117
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,759
domination okay so let's have an idea

now of iterative iterated removal of

121
00:04:50,449 --> 00:04:52,319
different payoffs in it we look at it we

122
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,150
begin to think okay let's suppose you

00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,770
want to find the Nash equilibrium with

124
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,720
this game well it gets a little

125
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,460
complicated because you have to if you

have to consider all the possible

combinations one thing we can begin to

129
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,170
do is look for strictly dominated

130
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:09,689
strategies and just get rid of those so

131
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,660
for instance in this game what's true if

we look at this game we notice that R is

133
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:19,230
strictly dominated by C right so the the

136
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,480
then they get in every one of these

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,910
entries so you would be strictly better

00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,060
playing C than R no matter what the

other player mixed so whatever the other

player does you get a strictly higher

144
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,540
payoff from the center than R so we

145
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,069
should just get rid of our altogether

146
00:05:47,269 --> 00:05:49,350
and now we've got a simpler game right

147
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,480
so the idea is boom we get rid of our

148
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,340
all together now we've got a simpler

149
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:53,870
game
游戏

150
00:05:54,069 --> 00:05:57,720
okay so let's iterate on that logic so

151
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,329
now there's no domination strict

152
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:03,990
domination any longer between for the

153
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:06,900
for the column player because the column

154
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,250
player is actually indifferent between

157
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:18,560
here is that the middle strategy of the
这是

158
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,960
row player is not dominated right so the
行播放器没有被主导，所以

159
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,420
middle strategy does strictly worse than
中间策略确实比

160
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,480
the up strategy for the row player right
排球运动员的正确策略

161
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,670
so three is better than one two is

162
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,920
better than one no matter what happens

163
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,230
you're better off playing up then middle

164
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,730
so M is strictly dominated by you

165
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,079
in this case we can get rid of em

together that collapse the game further

167
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,400
so now we're iterating we've got a

168
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,850
simpler game now we see that in this

169
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,740
case now once we've done this removal

170
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:55,050
now C is dominated by L right so the

column player would always get better

see where this is going

225
00:09:23,929 --> 00:09:26,009
between the two but when we're looking

00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:28,979
at the row player we notice that the row

240
00:10:13,669 --> 00:10:16,620
let's suppose that you played a half on

00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:23,579
the other player went left and you're
另一个玩家走了，你

244
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:25,740
playing half up half down you get a path
半上半下玩法

245
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:31,319
of 1.5 if you were doing this and the

246
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:35,279
other player was playing C you would get
其他玩家在玩C，你会得到

247
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,559
a half of zero and a half of 4 you would
零的一半和4的一半

248
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:41,069
get two so there's when we look at

249
00:10:41,269 --> 00:10:44,939
playing a half half then what would we
打一半，那我们会怎么做

250
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:46,979
end up with if we allow for that mixture

251
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,589
right we put in a mixture we would end

252
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:56,099
up having uh oops that happen we would

253
00:10:56,299 --> 00:11:03,629
end up with 1.5 1 and a 2 1 so we end up
最终得到1.5 1和2 1所以我们最终

254
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,769
here

255
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,289
with something which strictly dominates
严格控制的东西

256
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:11,939
middle so playing a half on up and a
中间，所以玩了一半，一个

257
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:16,109
half on down gives the row player a
一半下来给行玩家一个

258

strictly higher payoff than they would
严格高于他们的回报

259
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:22,019
get by playing middle so in this case M

260
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:24,240
is dominated by the mixed strategy that

263
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:33,870
M so in that we're down to a reduced

264
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,419
game now this game doesn't really reduce

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,179
any further the column players and

actually if you want to go through and

276
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:07,709
is fully indifferent in this game so you

can go through and analyze all the Nash

of a weakly dominated strategy is that

actually chosen by the column player

00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,269
of this then we end up with a situation

421
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,230
we would remove up first and then we

422
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,930
would end up with down left so so

depending on on how you go through this

425
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,339
are left so there are things that you

know where the order matters and that

427
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:58,619
somewhat problematic okay um iterative

432
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,049
dominated strategies given what remains

433
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,180
we iterate on that Nash equilibria are a

434
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,579
subset of what remains so it's a nice

435
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:18,079
simple solution concept that helps us

438
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:25,259
also ask whether or not we see such

442
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:35,579
strategies and moreover iterating on
