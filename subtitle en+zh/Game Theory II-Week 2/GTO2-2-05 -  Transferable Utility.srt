78
00:03:14,539 --> 00:03:16,230
of power you can see where the quasi

linearity where's the linearity part of

84
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:29,310
is okay so when we start talking about

85
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,650
mechanisms in this world then we can

split the mechanism into making a choice

89
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:41,969
cross RN so what it's doing is is first

90
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:43,439
of all going to make a choice out of the

91
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:48,750
X and then also have payments in an RN
 X，然后在RN中付款

92
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:53,219
so X and X is a non-monetary outcome and

93
00:03:53,419 --> 00:03:56,310
we'll use the term money here it's not

94
00:03:56,509 --> 00:03:58,170
clear exactly what the transferable good

95
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,850
is but there's some way of moving

96
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,219
something back and forth which people

97
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:05,610
can equate with utility so there's some
可以等同于效用，所以有一些

98
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:07,469
non-monetary outcome so often these are

called public decisions the aspect which

101
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,219
and then we've got these private

102
00:04:14,419 --> 00:04:16,949
payments where each person is making a

103
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:20,639
payment into the mechanism and if P is

104
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,838
negative then that means they're

107
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,600
this kind of assumption in terms of

108
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,629

113
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,370
money or wealth an agent has and second

and when we're thinking about the

143
00:05:54,769 --> 00:05:57,100
utility that individuals have so we have

144
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,810
now we're writing people's utility over

146
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:11,170
theta minus P I of theta right so and

147
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,540
this X can depend on theta what we're

going to depend only on their own type

154
00:06:30,209 --> 00:06:32,680
so a will say that preferences have

00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:52,218
it only depends on my own type so that

162
00:06:52,418 --> 00:06:54,139
means that once I know my own theta I

181
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,259
of just thinking about theta eyes we can
