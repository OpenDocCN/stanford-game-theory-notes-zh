00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,330
direct so let me draw it here so what

56
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,420
happens is all of the agents have some

57
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,100
types because we're in a Bayesian game

inside this mechanism and then some

62
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:33,069
complicated thing happens in here maybe

63
00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:35,259
we have information revelation there's

all kinds of maybe repetitions of agents

that we can look at this whole thing as

69
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,660
being a game right in the end this is

70
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,719
just a mapping from agents types and

73
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,069
so I can think about an equilibrium of

this game it's just some Bayesian game

00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:07,330
and so I can I can think about these

76
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,460
asses all being in equilibrium with each

77
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:11,830
other and and that's exactly what I do

78
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,780
when I talk about implementation if I

say that the mechanism implements a

00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,349
social choice function what I'm saying

81
00:03:17,549 --> 00:03:20,759
is that in equilibrium the mapping from

82
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,189
types to outcomes is the same as the

85
00:03:30,539 --> 00:03:32,680
punchline I want to show that I can make

87
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:39,280
and here's how I do it I take the

88
00:03:39,479 --> 00:03:41,740
original mechanism and I kind of embed

89
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,800
it in this new mechanism here so what I

90
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,770
do is I say I'm gonna make a new

92
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,480
as the type space so I'm gonna ask each

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,520
of the agents tell me what your type is

97
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:04,390
then I take that type that they've

98
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,129
declared so let me first of all give a

99
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:09,368
name to that so so I'll call that policy

102
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:17,889
function of his true type right so he

103
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:20,408
has he has some way of deciding based on

his type how to reveal something to me

112
00:04:36,819 --> 00:04:40,189
into s the strategy profile that we had

that type all then figure out what

00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,670
simulate the original mechanism so if

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,860
that isn't my real type that means I'm

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,810
changing the strategy that I would have

144
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:52,278
played in the original mechanism I'm

00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:53,930
kind of what I would have preferred to

00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:56,810
also if I lie to the mechanism here I

would have preferred to lie to myself in

the original mechanism so that I would

effectively be playing a different

150
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,100
strategy than I was playing before and

151
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,199
of course the whole idea of an

equilibrium is that nobody can gain by

have wanted to lie to myself in the

157
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:19,490
now because it's already playing a

158
00:06:19,689 --> 00:06:20,899
strategy for me that's an equilibrium

for the original mechanism and of course

that being the case it chooses the same

outcome since the original mechanism so

162
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:30,379
kind of the the slogan for the

163
00:06:30,579 --> 00:06:32,629
revelation principle is that the agents

don't need to lie in this new mechanism

we feed their real types into the

original mechanism instead we already

apply this strategy of their types just

it the right thing that's the idea of

kind of technical concern too to mention

00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,879
shown you but it could actually

introduce new equilibria which we don't

it's worth telling you but but let me

give you the high level point here which

193
00:07:34,449 --> 00:07:36,468
is that the revelation principle really

194
00:07:36,668 --> 00:07:39,110
is important for mechanism design so so

of three ways to see it it tells us the

shows us that direct mechanisms are not

less powerful than indirect mechanisms

202
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,218
which is a bit surprising because it

sort of feels like direct mechanisms are

it's true for all mechanisms and that's

00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:19,670
really important for analysis so if I

want to prove something about the space

what the revelation principle tells me

manageable thing to do

prove things about mechanisms we always
