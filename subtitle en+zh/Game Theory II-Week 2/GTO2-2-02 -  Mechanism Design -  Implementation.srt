in this segment we introduced a very

6
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:21,429
theory and the intuition is that when we

7
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:23,289
often think about game theory we think

00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:53,799
we get to design the voting rules it can

we'll be speaking about how to model

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,269
this formally and what mechanisms aim to

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,439
it now but what will happen is we'll be

given a Bayesian game setting which

46
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,150
won't quite be a game be a setting and

47
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:24,969
then we'll add to it the ingredient that

will turn it into a game and we'll try

50
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:36,400
certain qualities and so so let's go

51
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,270
over it we have this tuple and let's go
上面有这个元组，然后开始

52
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:47,650
over it in order so n is simply the set

53
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,900
of agents and O is the set of outcomes
的代理人，O是结果集

54
00:02:52,099 --> 00:02:55,360
so we have the social choice function

55
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,360
that has certain outcomes for example we

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,509
possible candidates and that is that

58
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:10,270
said O then we have those types those

59
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,640
are the exactly the objects we saw in

60
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,860
Bayesian games again we don't yet have a
贝叶斯游戏再次，我们还没有

61
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,780
game here but the notion of type is well
游戏在这里，但类型的概念很好

62
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:19,480
defined and so we have and type really

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,150
all that private information to agents
给代理商的所有私人信息

64
00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,410
so intuitively think about it as in the

65
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,810
voting situation what is my preference
投票情况我最喜欢什么

66
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:32,069
ordering about the candidates what do I

67
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,840
know about the preference ordering of

68
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,020
other agents what do I know about what

70
00:03:40,229 --> 00:03:42,430
and all of that all that private

71
00:03:42,629 --> 00:03:47,050
information is my type we have as we
信息是我们拥有的类型

72
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,569
usually do a common prior probability

74
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,160
commonly known by the agent and we have
代理商通常知道的，我们有

75
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,400
a utility function that says given an
表示给定

76
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:05,560
outcome and given the types of the

00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,580
agents what is the utility to each of
代理商对每个人都有什么用处

78
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,259
the players and so given that my
球员，所以鉴于我

79
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:18,778
preference ordering is what it is and
偏好排序是什么， 

80
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:22,620
given that a particular candidate was
鉴于特定的候选人是

81
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:24,759
elected for example

82
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,028
would give me some utility this is all

83
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:30,430
the setting that we as mekin designers

87
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,309
we we may know their the common prior on
我们可能知道他们的共同先验

88
00:04:45,509 --> 00:04:50,230
those types so now what is the mechanism
这些类型，现在是什么机制

89
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,718
a mechanism consists of those things

91
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:57,160
setting will make for a Bayesian game so
设置将使贝叶斯游戏如此

92
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,899
there's two things that missing are the

93
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,600
actions so so far we had no action for
到目前为止，我们还没有采取任何行动

94
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,819
the Able's so a mechanism simply

95
00:05:04,019 --> 00:05:05,680
specifies the action for example the
指定操作，例如

96
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:09,550
voting rules or the auction rules and it
投票规则或拍卖规则及其

97
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,770
also specifies because the actions if

98
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,230
they just live in a vacuum don't have
他们只是生活在真空中

99
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,629
any force so they need to interact with
任何力量，所以他们需要与

100
00:05:16,829 --> 00:05:18,160
the Setting Sun while the action simply

101
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:25,329
specify the the the outcome or more

103
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,550
so actions simply a set of actions for
所以动作只是一组动作

104
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,838
each of the agents for example in a
每个代理商，例如

105
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:36,968
voting situation it might be to specify

your entire ordering among the
您在整个订单中

107
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,620
candidates or to specify your top

109
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:50,110
and a mapping says based on those
并根据这些内容进行映射

110
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:53,199
actions for example as votes who is the
例如作为选民的行动

111
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,899
winner and as you see a for technical
冠军，正如您所见， 

112
00:05:56,098 --> 00:05:59,110
reason we don't necessarily find one
我们不一定找到一个的原因

113
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,319
winner or one so for choice outcome but
获胜者或一个这样的选择结果，但

114
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:06,819
a distribution over those outcomes often
这些结果的分布通常

115
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:08,050
for your intuition think of it as
为了您的直觉，将其视为

116
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,319
specifying a specific outcome you worked
指定您工作的特定结果

117
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,660
you usually won't lose any intuition you
你通常不会失去任何直觉

118
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,740
think about it that way and so this is a
这样想，所以这是一个

119
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:20,829
mechanism given a Bayesian game setting
给定贝叶斯游戏设置的机制

120
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:23,649
you add these two ingredients the
您添加这两种成分

121
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:26,170
actions and how they map to outcomes and
行动及其与结果的对应关系，以及

122
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,088
when you put those together you get a
当你把它们放在一起时，你会得到一个

123
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:32,410
patient game so how do you specify the
耐心的游戏，那么您如何指定

124
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,028
mechanism well the intuition is that we
很好的直觉是我们

125
00:06:37,228 --> 00:06:38,170
want to
想要

126
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:39,850
we want the agent to behave a certain
我们希望代理人表现出一定的行为

127
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,860
way we would like to reach a certain
我们想达成的目标

128
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,230
software choice outcome that's best for
最适合的软件选择结果

129
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,770
example we might want to find a socially
例如我们可能想找到一个社交

130
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,370
optimal Pareto efficient outcome we

131
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,310
might want in an auction set in two
可能希望将拍卖分为两部分

132
00:06:54,509 --> 00:06:57,069
layers to auction setting to maximize
拍卖设置最大化

133
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:01,870
our revenue and do that while not having
我们的收入，而没有

134
00:07:02,069 --> 00:07:04,180
control over the bathing game setting
控制沐浴游戏的设置

135
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,860
and so the trick is to set up the rules
所以诀窍是建立规则

136
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,460
of the game the mechanism to cause agent

137
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,009
to behave the way we want them even

138
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:17,740
though we don't have access to the

139
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:20,050
internal information and can directly

140
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,300
control the actions but we will set the
控制动作，但我们将设置

141
