doesn't talk about summing up valuations

instead it says something about not

we make a big deal of the fact that

we're not just talking about summing up

utilities we're talking about the fact

63
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,330
sounds like I'm saying free to

efficiency allows me just to sum things

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,580
with that well the answer is that if we

67
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,290
think about including the mechanism as

an agent if we kind of include them the

kind of don't matter because they always

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280
sum up to zero across all of the agents

utility to go around and then I kind of

shuffle the payments around in such a

that there's more money on the table and

00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,700
instead it's such a way that everybody

me also note we call this efficiency but

00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:08,109
like to make a restriction that says I

283
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,149
want a guarantee that I can actually

evaluate these functions tractable and a

okay so much for constraints that we

289
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,500
want to impose now let's think about

objective functions that we might place

291
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,469
on our mechanism here's one I might

actually like revenue so maybe I'm

selling something and I want a mechanism

298
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:49,599
it's gonna be a weekly budget balance so

299
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:52,779
that I know I never lose money but then

00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:56,349
maybe it's gonna be truthful but then

once these constraints are satisfied

302
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,258
they're still going to be maybe a space

of different mechanisms that would

304
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,439
satisfy those constraints and within

that space I might want to say that I

want to pick the mechanism that gives me

mechanism selects those that maximizes

profile notice here I'm using the the

318
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,029
theta notation for types instead of

319
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,189
values but but the the sense of it is

320
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:45,490
the same so the next of objective

00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:46,899
function that we might care about is

324
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,839
this makes sense if I don't actually

325
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,789
want the mechanism to make money but I

326
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:56,379
just wanted to make a good decision and

00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,719
the only reason that I have payments at

328
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:01,569
all is that quasi-linear or mechanism

329
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:04,899
design is easier than mechanism design

impossibility theorems that you've

332
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,789
already seen so and I might just prefer

333
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,199
strict budget balance that might be the

334
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,939
best thing but there are cases where

strict budget balance is impossible to
严格的预算平衡是不可能的

336
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:19,549
so I might just want to minimize the

337
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,490
amount of revenue that I collect so what

338
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,679
I might do is make it constraint for

week budget balance say at least I never

342
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:34,459
formalize this here by saying saying

343
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:36,589
what follows let me just note what you

344
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:37,969
see here at the bottom before I go

00:13:38,169 --> 00:13:40,099
through the definition I'm just for fun

I'm gonna do this as a worst case over

evaluations rather than an expectation

348
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:47,719
like I did in the previous slide so I'll

349
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:49,699
say that a transferable utility

again considering all of the functions X

the payments in their equilibrium

357
00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:13,159
strategy profile so here what I'm saying
策略简介，这就是我要说的

358
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,559
is that in the worst case worst from the

359
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:17,000
point of view of the minimization

360
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,919

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,349
valuations cause me to collect the most
估价使我收集最多

362

little as possible and of course I can

do this with an average as well okay

365
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,289
another thing I might care about is

fairness I might want to say my

mechanism is as fair as possible now

this might be something I want to say

but it turns out it's pretty hard to

370
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,209
formalize so let me give you an example

consider these two cases and ask

yourself which of them do you think it's

373
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,509
fair is fair so first of all I might ask

374
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:50,029
what about a case where I charge all of

00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:51,740
the agents a hundred dollars and I make

a choice that everybody hates secondly

380
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:05,359
like well there's a sense in which the

381
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:07,609
first one is really fair because it's

the same for everybody but we still sort

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,750
of have the sense that the second one is

384
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:13,339
better we wouldn't want a sense of

some kind of definition of fairness then

nevertheless says that the second thing

look over all the agents and how they do

mechanism is maximum fare when among the

429
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,579
mechanism and so I might put that into

430
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,529
the objective function and say I want a

446
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:46,490
selects those that minimize this ratio
选择那些最小化此比率的

447
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:51,979
so the ratio is the maximum over all of

448
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:54,139
the choices that could be made of the

sum of the agents utilities divided by
