about the Shapley values in this case

on today is whether any sub coalition

can gain by defecting from the grand

coalition again I'll invite you to pause

the answer
答案

48
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:15,950
so the answer is that a sub coalition

49
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,360
can gain in particular a and B together
可以一起获得a和B 

50
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,910
could form a sub coalition which would

51
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:25,600
do better than the grand coalition and

being paid according to the Shapley

53
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:33,290
values so a and B by themselves have

54
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:35,960
enough votes to pass the legislation

were to divide the hundred million

57
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:43,670
amongst themselves for example 75 25

58
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,219
then they would each get more than they

59
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:49,090
got under the Shapley value division and

60
00:02:49,289 --> 00:02:52,009
they would still pass the legislation so

61
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:54,050
this goes to show that while the Shapley

values may be fair they don't

66
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,570
instead we should look for different

67
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,040
ways that the parties could divide the

70
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:13,730
the question that we're going to think

71
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,570
about in this video

agents be willing to form the grand

coalition and the answer as we'll see is

75
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:24,890
that they would be willing to do so if

77
00:03:27,669 --> 00:03:30,620
which we'll call the core here's how we

78
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:35,600
define the core so we're going to think

about a given payment vector that's

members of the coalition and we're going

to say that the core that this payment

condition is true for every coalition

87
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,910
that could form and which is a subset or

88
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,270
equal to the grand coalition so every

89
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:07,880
subset of the grand coalition it's the
大联盟的子集是

90
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,700
case that for all agents in that subset

and if we sum across all of the agents

92
00:04:14,139 --> 00:04:17,870
in that subset excuse me the amount of

93
00:04:18,069 --> 00:04:20,538
payoff that the payoff vector says that

94
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:23,420
we give to each of those agents I in the

95
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,759
subset that sum

97
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,259
the agents would have gotten as a

98
00:04:30,459 --> 00:04:32,210
coalition if they had deviated and
如果他们偏离了联盟， 

99
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:36,829
instead formed that subset s so kind of
而是形成了这样的子集

100
00:04:37,029 --> 00:04:39,710
intuitively what we're guaranteeing here
直觉上我们在这里保证

101

is that the sum of the payoffs to all of

the agents in any sub coalition is at

00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:46,399
least as much as they could earn if they

actually did go off and formed that sub

coalition and you can see in the voting

106
00:04:51,098 --> 00:04:52,910
game that's what we saw wasn't achieved

107
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:55,218
that the amount that we were paying a

108
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:57,528
and B under the Shapley value payments

00:04:57,728 --> 00:04:59,809
wasn't as much as they could have gone

110
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:02,629
off and gone gotten on their own so if

111
00:05:02,829 --> 00:05:05,449
there doesn't exist any sub coalition
没有任何子联盟

112
00:05:05,649 --> 00:05:07,100
where the agents could have gotten more
代理商可以得到更多的地方

113
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,920
on their own then our pay effector is in
靠我们自己的薪酬影响者

114
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,949
the core and intuitively this is like
核心，直觉上这就像

115
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:14,749
Nash equilibrium because what we're
纳什均衡，因为我们

116
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:17,300
saying is the agents don't have any
说的是代理商没有

117
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,730
profitable deviations it isn't the case
实际情况并非如此

118
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,649
that any sub coalition could deviate

119
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:24,170
away from the grand coalition and end up
离开大联盟并结束

120
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,110
with higher payments for themselves the
自己支付更高的

121
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,670
way it's different from Nash equilibrium
不同于纳什均衡的方式

122
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,588
is we're thinking about groups of agents
我们在考虑代理商群体吗

123
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:34,040
jointly deviating so in a sense it's a
共同偏离，从某种意义上说

124
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,240
stronger notion than a Nash equilibrium
比纳什均衡更强的概念

125
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,730
we don't think only about unilateral
我们不仅考虑单方面

126
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,879
deviations here so anytime a solution
出现偏差，因此随时可以解决

127
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:46,009
concept is introduced to you there are
概念介绍给你有

128
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:47,778
two questions that you should wonder
您应该怀疑的两个问题

129
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:51,290
about the first is whether the solution
关于第一个是解决方案

130
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,290
concept always returns something
概念总是返回一些东西

131
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:56,329
analogously remember pure strategy Nash
类似地记得纯策略纳什

132
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:58,670
equilibrium doesn't always exist mixed
平衡并不总是存在

133
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:00,559
strategy equilibrium does always exist
战略均衡始终存在

134
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,259
so we might wonder is the core always
所以我们可能想知道核心始终是

135
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:05,028
non-empty does it always suggest at
非空的总是建议

136
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:08,480
least one payment profile to us secondly
第二个给我们至少一个付款资料

137
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,639
we might wonder is the core always
我们可能想知道核心始终是

138
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,740
unique when it does return something to
当它确实返回某些东西时是唯一的

139
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,139
us does it always return one thing does
我们做它总是返回一件事

140
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:17,629
it make a sharp recommendation or might
它提出了一个尖锐的建议，或者可能

141

speaks about also cases in which SMT do
