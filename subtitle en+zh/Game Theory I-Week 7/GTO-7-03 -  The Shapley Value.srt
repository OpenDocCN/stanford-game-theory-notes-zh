Shapley's axioms are going to give us a

handle on this so let's take a look at

that you would would think of in these

settings is going to satisfy so if we

think of two different members of

85
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:28,960
at some coalition that has neither I nor

86
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,539
J in it if we had I to that coalition we

giving the same thing to I as J when

that that everyone has had some

there's a situation where you you add a

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,968
person I to a coalition and they they

add absolutely nothing so no matter what

completely worthless no matter what

113
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,270
coalition we're looking at so the idea

114
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,600
is then the axiom is if an individual is

115
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,259
a dummy player then we give them nothing

now you know this is on one hand it's a

fairly reasonable axiom if somebody's

the other hand this depends very much on

the perspective you're taking so if

we're thinking about a society it could

something to those individuals so it

really depends on what the time

perspective is whether we're thinking

about social insurance and so forth but

134
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:26,290
axiom and is going to be a fairly

137
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:36,430
which you might think of more about the

suppose that we can think about looking

00:05:45,689 --> 00:05:47,829
very nicely into two different parts so
非常好地分为两个不同的部分

143
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:51,778
we can think of it as as you've got one
我们可以将其视为您拥有的

144
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:53,680
cooperative game you've got another one
合作游戏，你还有另一个

145
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,689
and then we think of what do you get
然后我们想到您会得到什么

146
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:56,949
when you sum these two things together
当您将这两件事加在一起时

147
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,290
and the idea is that if we're looking at
想法是，如果我们正在研究

148
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:02,230
two different cooperative games and then
两个不同的合作游戏，然后

149
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,819
we think about what would happen if you
我们考虑如果您

150
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:05,800
were trying to allocate something when

151
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,718
you sum them up you should get the same

152
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,749
thing from allocating one allocating

153
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:12,550
according to the second and then adding

154
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,249
those two things up okay so the idea

155
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:16,480
here is if we're looking at a

156
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,100
cooperative game where the value for

159
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,230
under the second game then the way that

160
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,180
we allocate values should be how we

fairly obvious in terms of what it means

169
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,990
harder you could think of this as a

axiom okay so what do we get from these

00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:25,660
three axioms the Shapley value and let's

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,460
have a look at exactly how you define

192
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,530
in it coalition without I we we then

193
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,310
take a peek at how much that generates

waiting that by different possible ways

could have done this okay so we'll make

sure we average over all these things so

203
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:10,270
we're going to dissect this in more

detail in a moment

205
00:08:11,389 --> 00:08:14,050
and what's the theorem the theorem is

206
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,699
that if we look at a coalitional game or

209
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,829
grand coalition so if we're making sure

00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:29,089
according to this formula looks a little

242
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:53,240
adding person two right so we could that

243
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,439
that would be one order in which we

244
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,439
could build a society up we could also

 2然后加人3然后再加人1 

247
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,539
right so there's a whole series of
对，所以有一系列的

248
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,589
different ways if we had a three person

253
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,329
contributions along the way so here

first person one contributes something
第一人称视角

255

256
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,569
then person two adds their production
然后第二个人添加他们的作品

257
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:26,329
and so forth so we end up with these
等等，所以我们最终得到了这些

258
00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:29,719
these different contributions and that's
这些不同的贡献，那就是

259

264
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,399
they were added next we weight this by

265
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,169
the different possible ways that we

267
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:56,389
before I was added then we also weight

272
00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:07,339
right so there's a a number of

273
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,859
individuals - the number that are
个人-人数

274

276
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:19,309
effect take that - the factorial gives
