00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:01,139
interim expected utility so let's talk
中期预期效用，让我们谈谈

142
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:02,819
about the expected utility that a player

143
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:05,610
has if they're at the interim stage well

144
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,629
we can say what does person I expect if

00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:11,249
they're of type theta I and the

146
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:13,860
strategies s are being followed and we

147
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,569
end up with a calculation which looks as

148
00:06:15,769 --> 00:06:21,180
follows first of all we can look at what

149
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:22,860
the possible types are so we're going to

150
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,050
be summing the person knows their type

151
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,120
then that can tell them something about

152
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,680
what they believe the probability of

153
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:31,199
other people's types will be we're going

154
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:33,480
to sum across those things and the

respect to those types

157
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,060
so that's one aspect of it the second

158
00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:46,530
aspect is that they also have to do the

00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:49,560
calculation of what they then believe

we going to see different actions and

169
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:13,560
so we've got the payoff as a function of
