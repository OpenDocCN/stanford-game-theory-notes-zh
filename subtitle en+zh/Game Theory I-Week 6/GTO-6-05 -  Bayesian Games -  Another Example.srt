82
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,368
probability P so this probability P

payoffs in here and the payoffs reflect

the basic structure that we talked about

you're if you're going to be shot at if

for the when they're looking at a

them away and so forth so we've got

payoffs that we can look at and you can

114
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,650
study this in a little more detail and

115
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:40,290
then the question is what what's

with the good suspect the innocent one

then what are they going to do

121
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,639
so let's first try and calculate what

the suspect is going to do and what we

they see their type of being good then

they should end up here they get a

00:05:12,589 --> 00:05:14,129
here they get a minus three if they

130
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:16,860
shoot a minus two if they don't so we

131
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,560
end up with a strictly dominant strategy
最终采取严格的主导策略

of not shooting if you're good so

of what they think the sheriff should do

should not shoot right so we can cross

00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:36,240
this out and say that the only possible
说出来，这是唯一可能的

139
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,090
strategy for a good player is that
优秀球员的策略是

140
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,670
they're not going to shoot okay now we
他们现在不会开枪了，我们

141
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,949
go to the bad player and we do a similar
去找坏人，我们做类似的事情

142
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:46,230
kind of calculation and basically the
一种计算，基本上

143
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:49,020
criminal is going to shoot in this case
在这种情况下，罪犯将开枪

144
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,960
right so we look the zero vs minus two
正确，所以我们看零与负二

145
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,319
two versus one the this shoot strictly
严格来说，这是两对一

146
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:59,009
dominates not for the bad player once
一次不为坏玩家统治

147
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:01,920
they know their type so that tells us
他们知道他们的类型，这告诉我们

148
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,780
that in in terms of either an interim
就临时而言

149
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:06,120
plan or even if we go back ex ante and
计划，甚至我们事前回去

150
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,139
try and figure out what these players
尝试找出这些球员

151
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,569
should do basically the good one should
应该基本上做的好

152
00:06:09,769 --> 00:06:11,639
not shoot and the bad one should shoot
不射击，坏人应该射击

153
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,829
and so now we've got a probability P
所以现在我们有概率P 

154
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:17,970
down here 1 minus P here and we want to
在这里1减去P在这里，我们想

155
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,970
ask what's the sheriff's best reply okay
问警长最好的答复是什么好

156
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,840
well basically what happens if they
好吧，如果他们会发生什么

157
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,079
shoot what are they going to get they
拍摄他们将要得到什么

158
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,139
get 0 down here the sheriff gets a minus
警长减为零

159
00:06:31,339 --> 00:06:33,560
1 up here so you're getting minus 1
在这里1，所以你得到负1 

160
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,770
times 1 minus P if they shoot if they
如果他们射击，则乘以1减去P 

161
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,629
don't shoot what do they get
不要射击他们会得到什么

162
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:41,939
if they don't shoot well they get zero
如果射击不好，他们将得到零

163
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:47,699
up here and minus two down here so they
在这里，减去两个在这里，所以他们

164
00:06:47,899 --> 00:06:52,110
get a minus two times P and so we can
减去P的两倍，所以我们可以

165
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,879
think of the situations when is it
想想什么时候

166
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,610
better to shoot when is it better not to
最好在什么时候拍摄更好

167
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,179
and you can check here that if P is
你可以在这里检查P是否为

168
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:03,929
greater than one-third right so if you

169
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:05,249
find that point where these two are
找到这两个在哪里

170
00:07:05,449 --> 00:07:06,809
exactly equal to each other that's going

171
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,059
to be the point where P is equal to 1/3

173
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:14,249
likely to be down here you're more

174
00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:16,679
likely to want to shoot and if P is less

175
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,730
than 1/3 then you would want to not so
超过1/3，那么您可能会不想那样

176
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,619
depending on what P is you're going to

equilibria of this game are going to be

the sheriff if P is greater than

185
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:05,699
than 1/3 they do not and for P equals

186
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:11,249
1/3 any mixture for the sheriff the
