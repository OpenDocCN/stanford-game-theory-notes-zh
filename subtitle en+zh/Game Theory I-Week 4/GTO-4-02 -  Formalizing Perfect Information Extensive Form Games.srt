we're gonna look at the simplest kind of

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:07,559
perfect information extensive form games

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,589
so recall the normal form games model

take action simultaneously and that

13
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:31,930
extensive form which makes the temporal

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:34,268
structure explicit so it allows us to

15
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,029
think more naturally about time there

are two different kinds of extensive

17
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,689
form games that we'll talk about in this

20
00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:47,500
form we'll start with the first case

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,378
basically they differ by whether the

26
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:05,560
extensive form is defined in a way

29
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:12,759
pieces to make it work so we need all of

these different pieces here and

31
00:01:15,739 --> 00:01:18,789
intuitively what's going on here is that

32
00:01:18,989 --> 00:01:21,429
we have a set of players as we did

33
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:25,359
before we have a set of actions which

37
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:36,250
the rest of this stuff is going to be

38
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,079
used to define the utility function and

in order to get to utilities we need to

40
00:01:40,618 --> 00:01:41,890
think about the temporal structure of

41
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,929
the game so we're gonna build up

42
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:46,329
effectively a game tree where players

take turns taking actions in the game

45
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,590
node where the game ends and we're gonna

46
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,869
have a utility marking that note so

47
00:01:56,069 --> 00:01:59,679
let's formalize that intuition we'll

48
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:02,109
start with a set of choice nodes so

49
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,549
these are going to be the nodes in the
这些将成为

50
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,948
tree where players take an action where

00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,880
call that set of choice nodes H now to

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,600
make the

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:19,060
nodes work we need to assign to a choice

55
00:02:19,259 --> 00:02:21,430
node all of the different actions that
节点所有的不同动作

56
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:23,469
can be taken in that choice node so we

57
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,330
have a function called the action
有一个叫做动作的功能

58
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:29,710
function Chi which assigns to each

59
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:31,960
choice node which actions it is that are

60
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:34,060
available to a player in that choice

61
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:37,480
node and we also have a player function

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,939
and the player function tells us for

63
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:42,219
every choice node who it is that gets to

64
00:02:42,419 --> 00:02:45,300
make the choice in that node

65
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,710
that's the choice nodes we have another

66
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:49,300
kind of nodes which are the nodes where

67
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,189
the game ends we call these terminal
游戏结束，我们称这些终端

68
00:02:51,389 --> 00:02:53,320
nodes so this is a different set of
节点，所以这是一组不同的

69
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,200
nodes it's disjoint from H and we call
节点与H不相交，我们称

70
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,710
it Z so this gives us all of the
 Z，所以这给了我们所有的

71
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:04,930
different nodes in our game tree now we
现在我们游戏树中的不同节点

72
00:03:05,129 --> 00:03:07,570
need the edges in the game tree and we

73
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,490
build those up using the successor

74
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,830
function so the way the successor

75
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,660
function works is that it's a mapping

from a choice node and an action that

was taken in that choice node to a new

79
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,450
choice node another choice node or a

80
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,870
terminal node and what we want is that

81
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:33,850
the successor function combined with the

82
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,820
nodes defines a tree and in order for

85
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,439
given new node so the way we say that

86
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,560
formally is that for all pairs of choice

finally talk about what the players
