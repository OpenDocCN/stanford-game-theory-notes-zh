00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:25,350
follow the tree like that and so I write

thing to notice about this induced

at is very small but as the size of the

would make sense as an equilibrium in

more convenient for a small game like

here if you like and try to find those

tell you what they are so the three

we're able to see that those are

test for a pure strategy equilibrium in

check and see whether there's any

look at bhce if player one was to

deviate here you can see there's no

equilibrium in contrast if I looked at

best response as CF is a

response to BG for player two but on the

not a best response to CF for player one

and that's it for this video thanks
