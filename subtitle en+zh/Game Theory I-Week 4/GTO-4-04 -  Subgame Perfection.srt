1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,509
let us now revisit the solution concept
现在让我们重新审视解决方案概念

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,010
for extensive form games and let's start
进行广泛的形式游戏，让我们开始吧

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:16,510
by doing it let's start by looking at
通过这样做，让我们开始看

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,370
the following example in this game there
下面这个游戏中的例子

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,489
are a number of Nash equilibria and here
有一些纳什均衡，这里

6
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:30,850
is one of them BH see what is BH play

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,549
one goes down here and down here
一个人在这里和这里下来

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,079
whereas player two goes down here and

9
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,948
down here under this strategy profile of
在此的战略概况下

10
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,038
course the outcome of the game is this
当然，游戏的结果是这样

11
00:00:45,238 --> 00:00:48,878
one and the payoff to both players is
一个，两个玩家的收益是

12
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,219
five
五

13
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,570
let's first convince ourselves that this
首先让我们说服自己

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:55,599
is indeed a Nash equilibrium so let's
确实是纳什均衡，所以让我们

15
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:57,969
hold players one strategy fixed and see
固定玩家一项策略，看看

16
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,248
if player two can profitably deviate

17
00:01:00,448 --> 00:01:04,748
from their current response well what

19
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,509
instead of going C I would go D they
而不是去CI会去D他们

20
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,819
could say that but that would an impact
可以这么说，但这会产生影响

21
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:18,340
the outcome at all given that player two
给那个玩家两个，结果

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,129
is going down B and so that's not a
沿着B下降，所以这不是一个

23
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:22,778
profitable deviation wouldn't change
盈利偏差不会改变

24
00:01:22,978 --> 00:01:26,340
their payoff the path to player two and
他们获得第二名玩家的收益， 

25
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,899
the other thing they could do is say I'm
他们可以做的另一件事是说我

26
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:32,709
going to go down this this way but that
这样下去，但是那

27
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,390
would in fact worsen their payoff
实际上会恶化他们的收益

28
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,549
because they would end up here with a

29
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,378
payoff of zero rather than the Pfizer

30
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:41,168
getting so player 2 cannot profitably

36
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:01,179
payoff of three rather than the Pfizer

37
00:02:01,379 --> 00:02:03,909
getting that not profitable and they

38
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:07,569
could also say I'm going to go down G

over here
在这里

40
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,880
but given that player 2 is going down e

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,460
that wouldn't matter though in any case

end up in this this outcome of the path

of 5 and so that's not profitable

44
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:23,100
deviation either so neither player has a

45
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,900
profitable deviation then by definition

46
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:28,920
it's a Nash equilibrium but there's
这是纳什均衡，但有

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,560
something a little disturbing about this
对此有些困扰

48
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:34,320
equilibrium let's clear the slides it's
平衡让我们清除幻灯片

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,840
a little less messy and let's again
少一点混乱，让我们再次

50
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:39,570
write down the strategy for player 1
写下玩家1的策略

51
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:44,910
going be H and let's focus on Indy on

52
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:46,759
this node right there
这个节点就在那里

53
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:53,730
why would player 1 actually do H because
为什么玩家1实际上会做H，因为

54
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,610
G dominated the G they get a pair of 2
 G统治了G他们得到了一对2 

55
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,660
rather than 1 and so even though it did
而不是1，所以即使它确实

56
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,830
lead to a Nash equilibrium there's
导致纳什均衡

57
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,350
something a little troubling about it
有点困扰

58
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,550
and the way to understand it is by
而了解它的方法是

59
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,969
claiming that they would go down H here
声称他们会在这里H下

60
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:14,580
play 1 is threatening player 2 and
第一局威胁第二局玩家， 

61
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,130
telling him listen do not consider going
告诉他听着不要考虑去

62
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,689
down here because I'm going to go down
在这里，因为我要下去

63
00:03:18,889 --> 00:03:21,390
here therefore and you would get a zero
因此，在这里您将得到零

64
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,580
so you'd better go here and get a 5 is
所以你最好去这里得到5分

65
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,340
what player 1 saying is saying to player
玩家1对玩家说的是什么

66
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,330
2 but this is stretch is not credible
 2，但是这是不可靠的

67
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:33,680
because after all player 2 said
因为毕竟玩家2说

68
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:37,500
player 1 says that but in fact it would
玩家1说，但实际上

69
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:39,270
not be in their interests I believe that
我相信不符合他们的利益

70
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,840
player 1 actually would go down here and
玩家1实际上会在这里下场

71
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,480
so how do we capture this in a formal
那么我们如何在正式形式中

72
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,430
definition that brings us to the notion
将我们带入概念的定义

73
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,280
of sub game perfect equilibria or sub
子游戏完美均衡或子

74
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:53,069
game perfection so let's first define
游戏完美，让我们先定义一下

75
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:55,950
the sub game it's a very obvious notion
子游戏是一个非常明显的概念

76
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,600
a looking at some node in the game node
看游戏节点中的某个节点

77
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,810
H the sub game of G rooted at H is a
 H植根于H的G的子游戏是

78
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,660
restricted restriction of H to this to
 H对此的限制

79
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:10,620
the descendants from from that from that
从那个的后代

80
00:04:10,819 --> 00:04:15,840
node and similarly what are the set of
节点，类似的是什么

81
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,060
all sub games of G well look at all the
 G的所有子游戏都很好看

82
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:20,449
nodes in G
 G中的节点

83
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:26,389
the set of all sub games is simply all
所有子游戏的集合就是全部

84
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,939
the sub game routine at some node in G
 G中某个节点的子游戏例程

85
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:36,680
and so a national Librium is a sub game
因此，国家图书馆是一个子游戏

86
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,600
perfect if it's restriction to every sub
如果对每个子项都有限制，则完美

87
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,790
game is also a Nash equilibrium for that
博弈也是那什纳什均衡

88
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,230
that sub game so if for example we go to
该子游戏，例如，如果我们去

89
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,079
the previous slide and we consider again
上一张幻灯片，我们再次考虑

90
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,139
clearing the slide for a second and if
清除幻灯片一秒钟，如果

91
00:04:54,339 --> 00:05:00,230
we look at the national erbium b h c e
我们看一下国家b 

92
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:04,040
and we decide to Nash equilibrium but
然后我们决定达到纳什均衡

93
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,699
among the sub games of this game the
在这个游戏的子游戏中

94
00:05:07,899 --> 00:05:11,360
subtrees of this tree of this tree is
这棵树的这棵树的子树是

95
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,939
this sub tree so here's a sub game it's
这个子树，所以这是一个子游戏

96
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:15,968
a game of a single player player 1 and
单人游戏1和

97
00:05:16,168 --> 00:05:19,819
the restriction of this Nash equilibrium
纳什均衡的限制

98
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,778
is simply that's action of going H but
简直就是走H的动作， 

99
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:25,999
this is not an equilibrium in this very
这不是一个平衡

100
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,730
simple tree because there's a profitable
简单的树，因为有一个有利可图的

101
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,449
deviation to G for the player and so
玩家的G偏差等等

102
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:34,218
while the to Nashville above the whole
而到纳什维尔最重要的是

103
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:38,749
tree is restriction to the sub tree here
树是对子树的限制

104
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,249
is not a Nash equilibrium
不是纳什均衡

105
00:05:40,449 --> 00:05:42,350
and therefore this Nash equilibrium is
因此，纳什均衡是

106
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:52,550
not a sub game perfect and so so we see
不是完美的子游戏，所以我们看到了

107
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,588
that in fact that captures the intuition
实际上捕捉到了直觉

108
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:58,310
of non-credible threat and notice also
不可信任的威胁，并且还应注意

109
00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:01,550
that one special case of the sub tree is
子树的一种特殊情况是

110
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:04,629
the entire tree so sub game perfect
整棵树，所以子游戏完美

111
00:06:04,829 --> 00:06:06,680
equilibrium has got to also be a
平衡也必须是

112
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:12,290
national ribbon so let's test our

113
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,730
understanding of this concept a little
对这个概念有一点了解

114
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,040
bit let's look at this tree and ask
让我们看看这棵树，问一下

115
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,040
ourselves what are some of the sub game

116
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,920
perfect equilibria there for example how
那里有完美的平衡

117
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,550
about a g CF well the claim is this in
关于ag CF的说法是

118
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,670
fact is sub being perfect now why is
现在事实是完美的，为什么是

119
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,399
that what is a
那是什么

120
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:44,899
G C and F so that gives you this outcome
 GC和F，以便为您提供这种结果

121
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:48,709
over here and you can check there's no
在这里，你可以检查没有

122
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,019
profitable deviation but you can also
有利可图的偏差，但您也可以

123
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:53,778
ask in all the sub games is there
在所有子游戏中询问

124
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:56,718
profitable deviation well let's look at
有利可图的偏差让我们来看一下

125
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:59,209
some of the sub games well for example
例如一些子游戏

126
00:06:59,408 --> 00:07:05,600
here there is a the stevie ation over
这里有一个方向

127
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,579
here but that would not be profitable
在这里，但那不会有利可图

128
00:07:07,778 --> 00:07:09,230
for pair two because they would go down
对于第二对，因为他们会下去

129
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:16,809
from eight to three now but over here is
现在是八点到三点

130
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,699
their profitable deviation for example
例如他们的利润偏差

131
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:25,459
two player two not really because if
两个玩家两个不是真的，因为

132
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:27,319
they deviate it over here they would end
他们在这里偏离它会结束

133
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,028
up with a five random the ten they're

134
00:07:29,228 --> 00:07:33,978
getting how about over here is their
他们在这里过得如何

135
00:07:34,178 --> 00:07:36,528
profitable deviation and this note to
有利可图的偏差和此注释

136
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:39,468
the agent one well no because if they
该代理人很好，因为他们

137
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:41,929
deviate they would get one rather than
偏离他们会得到一个而不是

138
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:46,399
two so in all sub games the restriction
