hey folks so let's talk now about

00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,040
optimal auctions and what we mean by

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,800
optimal auctions basically and up until

this point in the course usually when

victory claros mechanisms and so forth

10
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:24,190
and here the idea is that we'll think

about a seller designing an auction and

thing but instead to maximize the price

they're interested in maximizing

sometimes the seller doesn't sell the

00:00:59,549 --> 00:01:02,498
highest bid and that could happen in

little bit of that in a bit so here

we're going to think now about optimal

here's the risk now if we didn't have a

object now there's a possibility of no

00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,879
one below it then the reserve price is

119
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:53,439
going to kick in that's going to be the

00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,019
second highest price the second highest

121
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:57,579
bid we'll think of the reserve price as

if it was a bid and the second highest

123
00:05:00,149 --> 00:05:02,649
bid is now the reserve price and so

124
00:05:02,848 --> 00:05:05,528
we'll sell at that reserve if somebody

125
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:07,088
bids above it and the other below so

126
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:08,920
again second price auction that's going
再次进行第二次价格拍卖

127
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,218
to be the second highest and if both of

128
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:13,838
them been above it if both bidders

129
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:16,389
happen a bit above it then it'll just be

00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:18,699
the second highest bid that will be the

131
00:05:18,899 --> 00:05:21,329
price okay so that's the setting and

132
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:23,889
which reserve price is going to maximize
哪个底价将最大化

133
00:05:24,089 --> 00:05:26,019
the expected revenue so let's take a

134
00:05:26,218 --> 00:05:28,540
look at that so first thing to note it's
看着那个，首先要注意的是

135
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,610
still a dominant strategy to bid your
仍然是竞标您的主要策略

136
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,160
true value and in fact you could think

137
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,079
of the reserve price is just like a
底价的

138
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:37,689
third bidder in this case and so from
在这种情况下，第三竞标者

139
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:40,329
any bidders perspective you still want
您仍然想要的任何竞标者观点

140
00:05:40,528 --> 00:05:41,649
to be bidding your true value if it's a
竞标您的真实价值，如果它是

147
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:56,379
the analysis so if both sale if both

happen now with probability R squared

165
00:06:38,519 --> 00:06:40,199
then

00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:30,449
going to get a revenue of R so multiply

186
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,110
of that both people are above and then

187
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,689
we have this expected revenue so we end

188
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:44,550
up with an overall expected revenue of

189
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,189
this expression because if they're both

191
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:50,579
the overall expression that's the

193
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:56,550
here in terms of ours you can simplify

194
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,980
this so the expected revenue here is

195
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,870
given by this expression 1 plus 3 R

198
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:12,660
just maximize that with respect to R so

199
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,949
let's take the derivative with respect

facing two bidders in a second-price

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:42,149
you can do calculations so suppose let's

00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:44,758
do our calculation when we set the

1/2 in here do the calculation you end

215
00:08:54,289 --> 00:08:57,539
if you set a reserve price of zero then
如果您将底价设置为零，则

216
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,909
the expected revenue you get zeros for
预期收益为零

217
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,328
the R's you get one-third here so you

218
00:09:03,528 --> 00:09:05,549
end up with a lower this is just for 12
最终以较低的价格仅售12 

219
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,769
right so we end up with a higher

00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,618
expected revenue when we set the reserve

the seller now you don't want to you

224
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,748
know the the 1/2 was nicely chosen if we

225
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:23,789
set it too high then you have no chance

228
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:32,128
so it's hitting a sweet spot in terms of

229
00:09:32,328 --> 00:09:33,419
what the reserve price was so the

00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:42,808
in any case and it only has a

00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:51,479
high and it actually happens with the

239
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,990
increasing that reserve price led to

valuation would be exactly equal to zero

293
00:12:33,289 --> 00:12:38,490
okay so if you find the value of VI at

301
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,569
you would set the reserve price
