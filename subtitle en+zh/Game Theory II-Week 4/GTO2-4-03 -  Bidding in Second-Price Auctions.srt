we're going to assume that the other

bidders bid arbitrarily that's important

because we want to show that it's a

to show that no matter what the right

59
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,700
consider two cases the case where if

60
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,430
bidder I bid honestly he would win the
投标人我诚实地说，他会赢得

61
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:30,980
auction and the case where if bidding
拍卖和竞价的情况

62
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:38,090
honestly he would lose the auction so
老实说他会输掉拍卖，所以

63
00:02:38,289 --> 00:02:40,250
let's start by thinking about the case
让我们先考虑一下情况

64
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,620
where bidding honestly bitter eye wins
说实话，苦涩的眼睛胜出

65
00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:47,240
the auction in this case we can sort of
在这种情况下的拍卖，我们可以

66
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,800
look at this picture here so here we
在这里看这张照片所以在这里我们

67
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,890
have eyes true value at this level here
在此水平上具有眼睛的真实价值

68
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,850
and and then here we have the amount
然后我们有数量

69
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,040
that I bid now we're saying that I bids
我现在出价我是说我出价

70
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,430
truthfully I initially and so that means
老实说我一开始就是这样

71
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:03,730
that his bid is at this amount here and
他的出价是这个价位， 

72
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,800
of course in a second-price auction the
当然，在第二价拍卖中

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,870
amount that I actually pays is not his
我实际支付的金额不是他的

74
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:11,090
bid but it's the amount of the second
出价，但这是第二个的金额

75
00:03:11,289 --> 00:03:14,000
highest price which we'd shown here all
我们在这里显示的最高价格

76
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:17,240
right so let's let's do a kind of case
好的，让我们来做一个案例

77
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,040
analysis and think about what would have
分析并考虑会发生什么

78
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,760
happened if I had been differently if I
如果我与众不同，就会发生

79
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,760
were to bid higher then he would still
出价更高，那么他仍然会

80
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,800
win and he would still pay the same
赢了，他仍然会付出相同的代价

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,040
amount so nothing would change if he
金额，所以如果他

82
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,070
were to bid lower just a bit lower
叫低一点

83
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,630
again nothing would change as long as
只要什么都不会改变

84
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,130
he's still higher than the next highest
他仍然比第二高

85
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:41,060
bidder but if he bid sufficiently lower
投标人，但如果他的投标价足够低

86
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:43,219
then he would stop being the highest
然后他将不再是最高

87
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:46,430
bidder and he would lose the auction and
投标人，他将输掉拍卖， 

88
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:49,370
instead the next highest bidder would
相反，第二高的出价者会

89
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,660
win so what we can see here is that in
赢了，所以我们在这里可以看到的是

90
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,340
the case where I has the highest
我最高的情况

91
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:58,820
valuation and he changes his bid four
估价，他更改了出价四

92
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,920
things can happen three of them it
事情可能会发生三个

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,360
doesn't make any difference to him and
对他没有任何影响

94
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,240
in one case something changes and what's
在一种情况下，某些事情发生了变化，这是什么

95
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,680
important here is in the case where
重要的是

96
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,689
something changes things get worse for
事情改变了，事情变得更糟

97
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:11,000
bidder I because he used to be getting

98
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:13,490
positive utility right there was this

103
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,689
utility here and he
实用在这里，他

104
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:25,759
when he loses he's getting zero utility
当他输了时，他的效用为零

105
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,819
because he doesn't get the good and

108
00:04:32,348 --> 00:04:34,459
this situation with zero utility and so

111
00:04:38,769 --> 00:04:42,769
bid any way other than truthfully what
除了真实地出价以外，还可以出价

112
00:04:42,968 --> 00:04:44,809
about the case where he wouldn't be the

113
00:04:45,009 --> 00:04:48,230
winner if he were to bid honestly well
如果他要诚实地出价，那就是赢家

114
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,480
in this case if he bids lower he would
在这种情况下，如果他降低出价，他会

115
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:54,139
still lose and pay nothing if he bids a
如果他竞标

116
00:04:54,339 --> 00:04:56,629
bit higher he'll again still lose and

00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:59,149
pay nothing and if he bids high enough

118
00:04:59,348 --> 00:05:02,509
he'll eventually win but in this case if

119
00:05:02,709 --> 00:05:06,579
he wins he's going to pay this amount
他赢了，他要付这笔钱

120
00:05:06,778 --> 00:05:08,778
which we know is higher than his
我们知道比他高

121
00:05:08,978 --> 00:05:12,379
valuation and so he by bidding
估价，所以他通过竞标

122
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:14,420
untruthfully in the case where he isn't
如果他不在，那是不诚实的

123
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,579
the highest bidder he's either going to

124
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:18,528
pay too much pay more than the good is

126
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:25,489
the outcome and so again we can see that
结果，所以我们可以再次看到

127
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,100
there's no way that bidder I can gain by
我无法通过任何方式获得竞标者

128
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,679
changing his bid and and that's the
改变他的出价，那就是

129
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,300
whole proof notice that we didn't have

relationship between other people's bids

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,968
and their own valuations and because of

133
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:39,410
that we've shown that it's a dominant

137
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,429
making a remark about English and

138
00:05:49,629 --> 00:05:52,309
