在这些拍卖中的均衡是

141
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:14,278
not going to be always extremely easy so
不会总是那么容易，所以

142
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:16,050
let's think of a first price auction so
让我们考虑一下第一次价格拍卖

143
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,670
let's start with a very simple case to
让我们从一个非常简单的案例开始

144
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,490
analyze first two bidders both
分析前两个竞标者

145
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,769
risk-neutral and they get an independent
风险中立，他们获得了独立

146
00:05:22,968 --> 00:05:25,230
draw from a uniform distribution on zero
从零上的均匀分布得出

147
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:28,199
one okay so each of these two bidders so
一个可以，所以这两个竞标者都这样

148
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:30,449
we've got two bidders each person
我们每个人都有两个竞标者

149
00:05:30,649 --> 00:05:35,338
uniform zero one valuations and those
统一零一估值和那些

150
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:37,139
are drawn independently and the claim
独立绘制，索赔

151
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:39,838
here is that if we look at we want to
这是如果我们看一下我们想

152
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:41,278
get a Bayesian Nash equilibrium of this

153
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:44,519
game what are we going to have the bids

154
00:05:44,718 --> 00:05:46,889
are just going to be each person drops
只是每个人都会掉下来

155
00:05:47,089 --> 00:05:50,269
their value by half so if my values are
他们的价值减半，所以如果我的价值是

156
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:53,579
3/4 I'll save 3/8 if my value is 1/2
 3/4如果我的值是1/2，我会节省3/8 

157
00:05:53,778 --> 00:05:55,468
I'll say 1/4 right so I just take
我会说1/4对，所以我就拿

158
00:05:55,668 --> 00:05:57,449
whatever my value is and I just shade it
不管我的价值是多少

159
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,319
by 1/2 and that's my bid ok and so let's
加1/2，那是我的出价，所以让我们

160
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,968
go through and just verify that that's
经过并只是验证那是

161
00:06:03,168 --> 00:06:05,338
amazing Nash equilibrium okay so we want

162
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:06,660
to check whether this is in equilibrium
检查这是否处于平衡状态

163
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:11,218
so let's given the symmetry here we can

164
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:12,540
just check for one of the bidders so

165
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,519
let's suppose that the other bidder is

166
00:06:14,718 --> 00:06:16,740
actually whatever their value is they

167
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:20,218
bid a half of it and now we think about

168
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:23,429
bitter one and let's let bitter one

值还行，所以如果我要竞标s1，就让我们

172
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:33,929
suppose I put a bit of s1 in and the

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,550
get a utility of 0 ok so in terms of

187
00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:21,930
otherwise if the value of the other

196
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,520
this prescribed strategy so let's

199
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,470
what do we end up with we end up with s
我们最终得到什么，我们最终得到s

00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:58,770
1 equals 1/2 V 1 as being the solution
 1等于1/2 V 1作为解决方案

201
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,990
to setting that equal to 0 so if you

202
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,370
want to maximize this and you can check

the second-order conditions you want to

205
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,650
a condition where my optimal bid given

206
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,879
it the other person is bidding half

207
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:13,620
their value is 2 bid half my value as
他们的价值是我的价值的2一半

208
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:17,670
well ok so and again the calculation for
好吧，一次又一次的计算

209
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,319
the other person is exactly symmetric to
另一个人与

210
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:21,000
this so this is the basic Nash

211
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,400
equilibrium of this game so what we've

212
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,139
got is people bidding down and they're

213
00:08:28,339 --> 00:08:30,629
trading off a calculation implicitly in
隐式权衡计算

214
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:32,789
terms of what we're doing here if we

215
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,199
want to look at the calculation that we

216
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,319
were doing by increasing your by

217
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,189
decreasing your bid the the gain is that

218
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:43,259
you pay less conditional on winning but

219
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,509
you also win less of the time so the

220
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,099
trade off is coming at your you're

221
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:48,990
winning less of the time but then you're

222
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:51,509
paying less when you do win and so that

223
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:53,849
trade-off is exactly

224
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:56,319
captured to this maximization problem

225
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:58,799
and you want to shade your bid by a half

226
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,139
okay um this is obviously a very narrow
好吧，这显然是非常狭窄的

227
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,029
result we did two bidders uniform

228
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,839
valuations so we need to solve for this

229
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,250
thing because this is not incentive

compatible as a direct mechanism in

231
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:12,370
terms of dominant strategies right so

232
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:15,729
it's not a dominant we have no dominant

233
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:17,529
strategies here we're not getting

compatibility when you dissolve four the
溶解性时的四个

236
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,919
equilibrium and no more generally you

237
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,449
could solve for you know if we had n
可以解决您的问题，如果我们知道

238
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:27,490
bidders instead of two what would

239
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,959
devalue what would the equilibrium look
贬值均衡的面貌

240
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,870
like then it's going to look like

241
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,939
instead of shading your bid by a half
而不是将出价降低一半

242
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:35,589
you should general formula is going to
你应该将通用公式

243
00:09:35,789 --> 00:09:38,859
be n minus 1 over n right so when n is 2
是n减去n的1，所以当n是2时

244
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:42,879
this is 1/2 when n is 3 then it's going
这是1/2当n为3时

245
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,909
to be 2/3 when n is 4 you go up to 3/4
当n为4时为2/3，则上升到3/4 

246
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,559
and so forth and so you just keep
依此类推，所以你只要保持

247
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:49,329
climbing in terms of how much you're
根据你的身高攀升

248
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,219
bidding and what's happening well it

249
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:53,529
gets harder and harder to win with more

251
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,279
going to have to bid closer and closer

252
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,529
to your value to have a chance to win

253
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,339
and then the trade-off is just that you

254
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:05,139
know as you as you lower your bid much

255
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:08,709
beyond something that's a very close to

257
00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:12,909
and so you're going to end up having
因此，您最终将不得不拥有

258
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:14,439
this trade-off be closer to the actual
这种权衡更接近实际

259
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,299
value you can go through and do the

260
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
calculation it's going to be very

261
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,839
similar to what we did just a different

calculation in terms of integrals now

00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,339
below you not just the other person

265
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:26,139
below you so that's a slightly more

266
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,569
complicated integration but basically

269
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:36,519
problem what we did here is we only

270
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,219
verified that this was in equilibrium so

271
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:42,490
we guessed the equilibrium and then

verified it I'm how do you actually find
