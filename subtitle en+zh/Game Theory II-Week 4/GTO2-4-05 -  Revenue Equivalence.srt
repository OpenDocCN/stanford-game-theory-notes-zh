would have been just a little bit more

in a second price auction the seller's

00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,670
that's this is the expression that I get

it's not quite as easy to see that they

the second price auction does but

119
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,430
basically what I want to reason is that

00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,290
in a first price auction the bidder with

121
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:01,870
the highest value gets the good and I

122
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,600
can argue this essentially by saying
基本上可以说

123
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,040
every symmetric game has a symmetric
每个对称游戏都有一个对称

equilibrium a the first price auction

126
00:05:10,288 --> 00:05:13,120
because everyone's iid and so in a

127
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,800
symmetric equilibrium of this game a
该游戏的对称平衡a 

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,468
higher valuation is gonna happen if and
如果和

129
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:19,270
only if a bidder has a higher bid and
仅当投标人具有更高的出价并且

130
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,889
that's gonna mean that the person with
那意味着那个人

131
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:24,300
the highest valuation wins the auction
最高估价赢得拍卖

132
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,360
so then I conclude that a bidder in a
因此，我得出结论： 

133
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,710
first price auction is going to have to
第一次价格拍卖将不得不

134
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,509
pay on expectation the same amount as

the same bidder would pay on expectation

136
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:40,120
in a second price auction and because

137
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,338
only the winner has to pay anything in a

138
00:05:42,538 --> 00:05:44,528
first price auction that means everyone

139
00:05:44,728 --> 00:05:46,718
should bid they're expected payment

140
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:48,670
conditional on being the winner of a
以成为某人的获胜者为条件

141
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,850
second price auction so each bidder in a
第二次价格拍卖，因此

142
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,550
first price auction should imagine that
第一次价格拍卖应该想象

143
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,040
they're the highest bidder and then bid
他们是出价最高的人，然后出价

144
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,850
the expected second highest bid
预期第二高的出价

145
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,560
conditional and their value being the
有条件的，其价值是

146
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,310
highest sample from the distribution and
分布中的最高样本

147
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:07,899
you might think this is kind of strange
您可能会认为这有点奇怪

148
00:06:08,098 --> 00:06:11,350
because of all of the N bidders n minus
因为所有N个竞标者n减

149
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:12,670
one of them will be wrong when they do
其中之一会做错

150
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,139
this conditioning only one of them

151
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:14,639
actually
其实

152
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,079
we'll be the highest bidder so why
我们将成为出价最高的人，为什么

153
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:17,400
should they all bid as though they think
他们是否都应该像他们认为的那样出价

154
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,590
they're the highest bidder well the
他们是出价最高的人

155
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,718
reason this makes sense is that the only
之所以有意义是因为

156
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,370
bidder that this matters to is the
重要的竞标者是

157
00:06:23,569 --> 00:06:25,620
bidder with the highest valuation and so
估价最高的竞标者等等

158
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,990
if the bidder turns out in fact to win

159
00:06:28,189 --> 00:06:30,180
the first price auction then he was

160
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:31,590
right to do this conditioning and
进行此调节的权利，以及

161
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,569
otherwise his bid doesn't matter anyway
否则，他的出价无所谓

162
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:35,310
and so the fact that he conditioned rung
因此，他对梯级进行调节

163
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:39,300
is okay so so thinking now about the
没关系，所以现在考虑

164
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,939
highest bidder if his valuation VI is
最高出价者，如果他的估值VI为

165
00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:44,910
the high value then there are n minus 1
高值则有n减1 

166
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:48,900
other values which are below his and so

167
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,670
all he knows is that they're drawn from

168
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,310
the uniform distribution on the interval

169

170
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,900
thinking about first price options in

the case of a uniform distribution and

172
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,569
thus the expected value of the second

conditioned on the first highest bid so

178
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:14,730
we're now going to think about the

biggest of the draws among the remaining

do a ton of calculus to actually figure

verify that it's an equilibrium and so

characterization is that the allocation

476
00:19:48,099 --> 00:19:51,470
monotonic and so the there of course it

00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,579
doesn't have to ever hit one it could

485
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,419
so now let's think about first of all

491
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,460
all let's think about his value well as

00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,819
I argued before this is his value for

497
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:43,579
when he has kind of lied to himself and

498
00:20:43,779 --> 00:20:44,299
so he gets a different allocation

499
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,430
probability so let's think about what

those things look like on the picture

501
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:50,629
well notice that these expressions are

502
00:20:50,829 --> 00:20:54,919
products it's a value multiplied by an

503
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,379
allocation probability so we can see

504
00:20:57,579 --> 00:20:59,990
that kind of in the picture as a

511
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:24,409
this whole shaded region here is that

512
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:26,839
product so the area of that region is

that it's 0 oh pardon me um okay so so
那是0哦，对不起，我很好，所以

00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,599
what is this so now it's time to think
这是什么，现在该考虑

562
00:23:35,799 --> 00:23:38,659
about this kind of crazy integral so so

563
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:39,950
how let's actually think about what the

564
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,349
payment identity is well this first term

565
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,210
here is the one that we've been thinking

566
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:46,879
about all along right that's the area of

570
00:24:00,339 --> 00:24:04,039
at on the previous slide now what are we

571
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,119
subtracting here this is the integral

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,769
in other words it's the area underneath

575
00:24:23,099 --> 00:24:26,769
so the payment is the whole rectangle

576
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,039
minus this stripey region here and of

577
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,950
course that's the the gray region that

578
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,649
I'm showing you on the slide so the

582
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:50,809
interesting whoops okay so then I can

583
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:53,389
put those two things together and figure

00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,220
the other way around everything switches
反过来一切都切换

694
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,379
so I get Zed ones and said twos in the
所以我得到了Zed并在

695
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:49,930
other way and and both times I have the
反过来说，两次我都有

696
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,250
inequality pointing this way because
不平等之所以这样指出，是因为

697
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,500
that's that's what we always started out
那就是我们一开始就做的

698
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,019
with so so basically what this is saying
基本上这么说

699
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,240
is an agent of type Zed one wouldn't
是Zed类型的代理，不会

700
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,129
want to lie and pretend to have type z2
想要撒谎并假装具有类型z2 

701
00:30:03,329 --> 00:30:05,710
and similarly an agent of type z2
同样是z2类型的代理

702
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,569
wouldn't want to lie and pretend to have
不想撒谎和假装有

703
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:09,899
type said one either
类型说一个

704
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,119
okay well I've got these two different
好吧，我有这两种不同

705
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,430
inequalities here so I can just add them
不平等在这里，所以我可以添加它们

706
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:18,579
together and if I do that then that
在一起，如果我这样做，那

707
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:21,629
causes these P terms to cancel out and
使这些P项抵消并

708
00:30:21,829 --> 00:30:24,159
so then I just get these two things
所以我就得到这两件事

709
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:31,269
added together and when I do that I end
加在一起，当我这样做时，我结束

710
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,649
up with
与

711
00:30:32,849 --> 00:30:37,389
this expression here and then I can just
这种表达在这里，然后我就可以

712
00:30:37,589 --> 00:30:40,839
factor that expression and I end up with
因素的表达，我最终与

713
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,329
this simpler inequality here that
这里的不等式

714
00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:44,440
doesn't talk about the payments at all
根本不谈论付款

715
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,659
and I
和我

716
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:48,579
you can verify that for yourself that's
您可以亲自验证

717
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:50,379
just some simple algebraic manipulation
只是一些简单的代数运算

718
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:54,669
and really the monotonicity requirement
真正的单调性要求

719
00:30:54,869 --> 00:30:57,639
just pops directly out of this
只是直接从中弹出

720
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,609
expression here so in particularly you
在这里表达，尤其是你

721
00:31:00,809 --> 00:31:03,690
can see that if Z 2 is bigger than Z 1
可以看到Z 2是否大于Z 1 

722
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,629
meaning that this term here is positive
表示这里的这个词是肯定的

723
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:09,669
then in order for this inequality to be
那么为了使这种不平等成为

724
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:11,680
true in order for this whole thing to be
为了使整个事情成为真

725
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,869
non-negative we have to make sure that
非负的，我们必须确保

726
00:31:14,069 --> 00:31:16,690
this is also not negative so we can
这也不是负面的，所以我们可以

727
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:19,299
conclude that this being positive
得出结论，这是积极的

728
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,169
implies that this has to be positive
暗示这必须是积极的

729
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:27,190
oh sorry mistake on the slide I should
哦，抱歉，幻灯片上的错误我应该

730
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:33,009
say is positive so I'll change that in
说是肯定的，所以我将改变它

731
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:36,940
the slides so in other words it means
幻灯片，换句话说，这意味着

732
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,680
that the x function has to be monotone
 x函数必须是单调的

733
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:47,169
non-decreasing it means that when when
不减少意味着什么时候

734
00:31:47,369 --> 00:31:48,659
this number is bigger than this number
这个数字大于这个数字

735
00:31:48,859 --> 00:31:50,950
this number has to be bigger than this
这个数字必须大于这个

736
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,419
number so that means the function has to
数字，这意味着该功能必须

737
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:58,329
be weakly going up and that's that's
虚弱地上升，那就是

738
00:31:58,529 --> 00:31:59,710
exactly what monotonicity says so that
确切地说，单调性是这样的

739
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:01,240
establishes this second part of the
建立了第二部分

740
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,200
proof all right so now there's only one
证明没事，所以现在只有一个

741
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,089
last thing to say and that is that this
最后要说的是

742
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:12,009
payment identity is is required so so
要求提供付款身份，所以

743
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,109
let's see what I want to say here is
让我们看看我想说的是

744
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:16,269
that the strategy profile is a Bayes
战略概况是贝叶斯

745
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:19,720
Nash equilibrium implies that we need
纳什均衡意味着我们需要

746
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,279
the payment identity the payment vanity
付款身份付款虚荣

747
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,740
didn't just kind of suffice to give us a
不仅仅是给我们一个机会

748
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,480
basic Nash equilibrium but we actually

749
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,720
need to have it so I'm gonna start with
需要它，所以我要开始

750
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,579
those same two inequalities that we just

751
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,950
talked about before and now I'm going to

752
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,899
do something different I'm gonna solve

753
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:37,119
each of them for this expression so I'm
他们每个人都为此表达，所以我

754
00:32:37,319 --> 00:32:38,980
going to kind of rearrange them you
要重新安排他们你

755
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,430
notice they both have a P I said to

756
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:43,440
given
给定

757
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,549
and @p I said one given s and so if I
和@p我说了一个给定的s，所以如果我

758
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,039
rearrange things then I can I can get
重新整理事情，然后我可以得到

759
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,659
them so they both have that on one side
他们，所以他们都在一侧

760
00:32:51,859 --> 00:32:54,180
of the expression and when I do that I
的表达，当我这样做时

761
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,869
end up with one of the equations looking
最终得到其中一个方程式

762
00:32:58,069 --> 00:32:59,369
one of the inequalities looking like

763
00:32:59,569 --> 00:33:05,720
this and the other one looking like that
这个和另一个看起来像那样

764
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,129
and in total I can think of that as
总的来说，我可以认为是

765
00:33:10,329 --> 00:33:13,349
upper and lower bounds on the
上限和下限

766
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:15,299
differences in expected payments that

767
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,700
have to be made between agents of type Z

768
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,659
2 and agents of type said 1 so in other

769
00:33:21,859 --> 00:33:24,480
words this difference in payments whoops
用词表达这种支付差异

770
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,210
this difference in payments here has to

771
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:33,089
be not less than this amount and not

772
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:36,869
more than this amount well that's fine

773
00:33:37,069 --> 00:33:39,240
but this just looks like a lot of messy
但这看起来很乱

774
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,069
math it's not clear why these upper and

775
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,169
lower bounds are very helpful to me well

776
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:44,519
here again we want to go back to our

777
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,369
pictures so let's visualize this on the
图片，所以让我们在

778
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:51,389
graphs that we were looking at before so
我们以前看过的图形

779
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:54,359
so here I've just written the upper and
所以在这里我只写了上部

780
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,129
lower bound expression for you again so
下界表达式再次为您

781
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:59,519
that you can compare it and here is the
您可以比较它，这是

782
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:04,289
upper bound and here is the lower bound
上限，这是下限

783
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,930
and let's think about what those numbers
让我们考虑一下这些数字

784
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:14,130
mean well here I'm multiplying by Z 2 so
意思是这里我要乘以Z 2 

785
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:18,840
here's the distance Z 2 and here I have
这是距离Z 2，我有

786
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:21,330
the allocation probability of an agent

787
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:23,699
of type Z 2 minus the allocation

788
00:34:23,898 --> 00:34:25,019
probability for an agent of types that
一个类型的主体的概率

789
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:27,780
one and that's this difference here and
一个，就是这里的区别， 

790
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:33,269
so in total the upper bound is this
所以总的来说上限是

791
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:36,180
shaded region here so the payment
这里的阴影区域，所以付款

792
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,959
difference can be no more than that
差异不能超过

793
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,640
the lower bound is Z 1 multiplied by
下限是Z 1乘以

794
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,530
that same difference so I have that same
同样的差异，所以我也一样

795
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,420
difference that I had before now

796
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,780
multiplied by Z 1 so that gives me this
乘以Z 1，所以给我这个

797
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,260
shaded region and the important thing to
阴影区域和重要的是

798
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,180
notice about these two
关于这两个的注意

799
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,399
regions is that they intersect the curve
区域是它们与曲线相交

800
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,680
at different points so this one touches
在不同的地方，所以这一点感动

801
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,899
the curve right there and this one
那里的曲线和这一个

802
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:11,579
touches the curve right there well I can
我可以很好地触及曲线

803
00:35:11,778 --> 00:35:13,589
argue this more formally using calculus
用微积分更正式地争论这一点

804
00:35:13,789 --> 00:35:15,780
but if you think about it it's easy to
但是如果您考虑一下，这很容易

805
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,490
get an intuition that makes it clearer
得到直觉，使之更清晰

806
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,500
but the only payment rule that can

807
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:22,289
satisfy these upper and lower bounds for

808
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:24,568
every given pair of types is said 1 and

810
00:35:27,949 --> 00:35:31,079
exactly to the shaded region that's

811
00:35:31,278 --> 00:35:34,289
shown here basically it needs to touch

812
00:35:34,489 --> 00:35:37,710
the curve everywhere because if I change

813
00:35:37,909 --> 00:35:39,599
that 1 and Z 2 I still need to have the
那1和Z 2我仍然需要

814
00:35:39,798 --> 00:35:42,829
problem the property that it's never
质疑从未有过的财产

815
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:46,169
less so it's never more than that amount

816
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:49,950
and it's never less than that amount and
而且永远不会少于那个数量

817
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:52,619
so as I kind of move around I need to

818
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,359
make sure that I always have those sort

of points of contact with the curve and

the only way for that to work everywhere

822
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:02,339
everywhere so kind of in an intuitive

823
00:36:02,539 --> 00:36:04,859
level that that should be convincing to

824
00:36:05,059 --> 00:36:06,780
you and if you'd like to see the the

825
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,609
proof with calculus you can look at the

00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:09,960
the book citation that I gave you at the

827
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:15,480
beginning and that pretty much gives us

828
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,280
the payment identity in order to get the

basically essentially all I really mean

that it turns out most of the options we
