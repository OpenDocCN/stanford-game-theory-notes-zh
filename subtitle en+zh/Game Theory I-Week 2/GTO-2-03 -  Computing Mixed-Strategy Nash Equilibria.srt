00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,749
in this video we're going to look at how
在本视频中，我们将探讨

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:03,728
to compute the mixed Nash equilibria of
计算的混合纳什均衡

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:07,059
a normal form game and in particular

4
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:08,439
we're going to go through the example of

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,500
so far about equilibria kind of suggests

7
00:00:14,699 --> 00:00:16,390
that it's really easy to come up with an

8
00:00:16,589 --> 00:00:19,210
equilibrium but in fact as games get big

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,699
and general sometimes it can be pretty

10
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:23,530
tricky to find the equilibria have a
很难找到平衡点

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,690
game and Nash's theorem is kind of a

12
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,789
funny theorem because it tells us that

13
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:30,129
something exists but it doesn't tell us

14
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:31,809
how to find it it just tells us that it

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,489
has to be there it's a non constructive

16
00:00:33,689 --> 00:00:36,279
argument so what I'm going to tell you
论据，所以我要告诉你

17
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:38,589
today is sort of a starting point to

finding an equilibrium which is enough

20
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:46,479
you can turn this into a general

27
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:03,909
recall what a support is support is the

31
00:01:13,129 --> 00:01:16,569
an equilibrium support is a set of

33
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:19,808
probability for example that might be

34
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:24,459
the support of an equilibrium so for

35
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:26,980
battle of the sexes let's guess that the
两性之战，让我们猜测

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,959
subs let's guess that the support of the
潜艇让我们猜测

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,439
equilibrium is all of the actions so

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,539
let's look and intuitively that if

there's going to be a mixed strategy

41
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,058
what it should be so let's guess that

42
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,289
that's the support and then try to

43
00:01:44,489 --> 00:01:45,698
reason about what the Eagle Librium

44
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:50,259
would have to be given that support so

45
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:51,849
let's just introduce some notation to

46
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,179
make this work let's let player to play

52
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,140
then we can reason

53
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:17,110
that player too must have set P and 1

video at this point and just think about

why that would be true before I tell you

62
00:02:40,799 --> 00:02:42,910
needs to be in I don't have the answer

on the slide I'll just tell you the

78
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,280
say B is better then he could get even

the same for him to play B and F so that

88
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,719
means that we can reason that player 2

89
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:53,259
has set his probabilities P and 1 minus

92
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,009
bothered to think about this is we can

93
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:02,409
actually write that down in math so we

94
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:05,230
can say the utility for player 1 of

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,530
playing B and here I'm kind of abusing

96
00:04:08,729 --> 00:04:09,909
notation you should really understand

97
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:11,860
this to mean the utility for player 1 is
这意味着播放器1的实用程序是

98
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:15,430
playing B given that player 1 plays P 1
给定玩家1玩P 1，则玩B 

99
00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:19,870
minus P is equal to the utility of

100
00:04:20,069 --> 00:04:23,199
player 1 for playing F again given the

102
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,579
so then we can we can simply expand this

103
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,860
out um taking into account the actual

00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,809
payoffs of the game and learn something

105
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:39,079
useful so we can say if it's the case

106
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:41,028
given the same probabilities P and 1
给定相同的概率P和1 

107
00:04:41,228 --> 00:04:43,218
minus P the player 1 is indifferent
负P表示玩家1无动于衷

108
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:47,149
between playing B and playing F then
在玩B和玩F之间

109
00:04:47,348 --> 00:04:50,749
that means well when he plays B then he
这意味着当他演奏B时，他

110
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:54,199
gets 2 with probability P and he gets 0
以概率P获得2，而他获得0 

111
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,689
with probability 1 minus B so that's
概率为1减去B，所以

112
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:59,809
what we have written down here and when
我们在这里写下的内容以及时间

113
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:03,170
he plays F he gets 0 with probability P
他打F他以P出现0 

114
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,309
and 1 with probability 1 minus P and

115
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:08,420
that's what we have written down here
这就是我们在这里写下的

116
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,600
and now we just have a simple equation
现在我们有一个简单的方程式

117
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,540
in one variable so if we rearrange it we
在一个变量中，所以如果我们重新排列它

118
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,579
end up concluding that the only way that
最终得出结论， 

119
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:18,769
player 1 can be indifferent between play
玩家1可能在游戏之间无动于衷

120
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:21,649
and being at B and F is if P is equal to
而在B和F处是P是否等于

121
00:05:21,848 --> 00:05:28,399
1/3 in the same way we can reason that
以相同的方式我们可以推断出1/3 

122
00:05:28,598 --> 00:05:31,699
if player 2 was randomizing which we had
如果玩家2正在随机化

123
00:05:31,899 --> 00:05:34,100
just assumed that he was then player 1
只是假设他是当时的玩家1 

124
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,739
must make him indifferent and why is
必须让他冷漠，为什么

125
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:41,629
player 1 willing to randomize because
玩家1愿意随机分组，因为

126
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:43,160
he's simultaneously being made
他同时被制造

127
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,079
indifferent by player 2 so so now let's
对玩家2漠不关心，所以现在让我们

128
00:05:48,278 --> 00:05:50,509
say that player 1 plays B with
说玩家1玩B 

129
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:53,929
probability Q and plays f with
概率Q和f 

130
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:58,369
probability 1 minus Q so now we can just
概率1减去Q，所以我们现在可以

131
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:00,199
do the same thing as before where again
再做一次和以前一样的事情

132
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:02,509
you should understand this to me in Q 1
你应该在第一季对我理解

133
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:07,879
minus Q and likewise here and we can say
减去Q，同样在这里，我们可以说

134
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,649
we can just expand it out in the same
我们可以将其扩展到同一个

135
00:06:09,848 --> 00:06:13,689
way so if player 2 plays B then he gets
这样，如果玩家2玩B，那么他得到

136
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,230
1 with probability Q and he gets 0 with
 Q的概率为1，而他的概率为0 

137
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:21,619
probability 1 minus Q and if he plays F
概率1减去Q，如果他玩F

got out was interprete Balazs a

might also describe what happens in the
