this lecture is going to introduce the
本讲座将介绍

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,979
idea of mixed strategies and extend our
混合策略的想法并扩展我们的

3
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:08,140
previous concept of Nash equilibrium to
纳什均衡的先前概念

4
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:12,069
this new definition let's begin by
这个新定义让我们开始

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:14,609
looking at the matching pennies game
看配套的便士游戏

6
00:00:14,808 --> 00:00:16,600
recall that it would be a pretty bad
回想起来那将是非常糟糕的

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,699
idea to play any deterministic strategy
发挥任何确定性策略的想法

8
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:21,879
in this game for example if player two
在这个游戏中，例如，如果玩家2 

9
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,568
were to play heads then player one would
玩头，然后玩家一会

10
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:27,429
want to respond by playing heads to get
想要通过努力获得回应

11
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:30,489
a payoff of one meaning that player two
收益为一意味着第二个玩家

12
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:33,219
would prefer to change details so that
希望更改详细信息，以便

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:36,579
he can get this payoff of 1 meaning that
他可以获得1的收益

14
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,589
player 1 would prefer to change to tails
玩家1希望改成尾巴

15
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,839
so he can get this payoff of 1 meaning

16
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,599
that player 2 would prefer to change
该玩家2希望更改

17
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,979
back to heads to get this payoff of 1
回到头来获得1的收益

18
00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:52,209
meaning that player 1 would prefer to

19
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:54,428
change back to heads as well to get this
换回头来得到这个

20
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:56,678
payoff of 1 where we started and so you
我们开始的1的回报，所以您

21
00:00:56,878 --> 00:00:58,989
can see there is kind of a cycle where
可以看到有一个循环

22
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:01,088
we just bounced around between the
我们只是在

23
00:01:01,289 --> 00:01:04,769
different cells of this game matrix and
此游戏矩阵的不同单元格以及

24
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,629
essentially argued that no pair of

25
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:09,700
deterministic strategies works for both
确定性策略对两者都有效

26
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,140
players so what does work for both

27
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,379
players well essentially it does make
玩家基本上可以做到

28
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:19,869
sense for players to confuse each other

29
00:01:20,069 --> 00:01:22,349
by choosing to play randomly so

30
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:24,759
intuitively instead of saying I'm going
凭直觉而不是说我要去

31
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:26,259
to commit to playing heads or I'm going
致力于发挥作用，否则我要走了

32
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,569
to commit to playing tails I can say I'm

35
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,778
let's try to make this idea formal

36
00:01:36,978 --> 00:01:39,128
before we talked about the idea of pure

37
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,409
strategies which we just equated to
我们刚才等同的策略

38
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:44,230
playing actions now let's think of

129
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:03,460
would actually arise well now that I've

130
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,110
defined what strategies are I can go
确定我可以采取的策略

131
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,910
back to my definitions of best response
回到我对最佳回应的定义

132
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,300
and Nash equilibrium and basically they
和纳什均衡，基本上

133
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,129
work the way they did before except I
除了我之前，他们像以前一样工作

134
00:06:15,329 --> 00:06:19,420
change all of the A's to asses so so
将所有A都更改为资产

135
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,230
that means I have to write these

136
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,699
definitions again and I'll go through
再次定义，我将讲解

137
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:23,800
them again but conceptually if you
他们再次，但从概念上讲，如果你

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,629
understood what best response and Nash

equilibrium meant in the case of actions
平衡意味着采取行动

140
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,360
then everything will work again so I

141
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,850
will say that a strategy s star I is an

care about this idea of Nash equilibrium

equilibrium in terms of just actions

245

refer to as pure strategy Nash

when we do all of this with aids instead

250
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,019
equilibrium and the sad thing about that

251
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,089
is that we don't get a theorem that says

that every finite game has one of those

just argued at the beginning of this

strategy Nash equilibrium it has one and

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:07,319
that is as I suggested before for both

50/50 that just happens to be what the

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,000
Nash equilibrium is here that comes from

266
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,889
the symmetry of the payoffs but that

00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:22,139
turns out to be the Nash equilibrium

268
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,549
here let's come back to the coordination

game well we've previously seen that

270
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,429
these two strategy profiles I'm circling

271
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,229
outcomes but remember an outcome isn't

272
00:12:37,429 --> 00:12:39,149
an equilibrium you know one one isn't

273
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,229
the equilibrium that would be wrong to
平衡是错误的

274
00:12:40,429 --> 00:12:42,599
say the right thing to say is that left
说正确的话就是离开

275
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:45,539
left is in equilibrium right right is an
左侧处于平衡状态，右侧是

276
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,729
equilibrium but it turns out there's
平衡，但事实证明

277
00:12:47,929 --> 00:12:50,569
another equilibrium here so it turns out
这里的另一个平衡

278
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:55,439
again 0.5 0.5 is a Nash equilibrium here
同样0.5 0.5是纳什均衡

279

aren't any mixed Nash equilibria of the
