actually really obey the predictions of

42
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:48,909
of the averages so in situations where

disadvantages
缺点

59

60
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,820
better than a four a kicker that going

61
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:40,200

64
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:44,969
bit more of a difference so this is an

65
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,660
asymmetric game it's a fairly subtle one

so we have to see whether or not we're

67
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:54,680
going to end up with the Nash

68
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,810
equilibrium in this game okay so why

69
00:02:58,009 --> 00:02:59,880
don't we do the following given those

70
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,510
numbers you we can pause the video and

71
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:06,270
solve the game so you can take a look at

89
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,550
make the kicker indifferent right so if

00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,200
the kicker kicks left we can figure out

92
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,550
right we can figure out what payoff they

93
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,100
get so in particular the goalies

101
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:34,119
if we do the same for the kicker going

we end up with we end up with PK the

probability that the kicker goes left is
踢手离开的概率是

108
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,689
point three eight so in terms of what we

109
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:57,910
found we found that goalies should go
发现我们发现守门员应该走

110
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,819
left forty two percent of the time that

0.38 which then puts them going right
 0.38然后使它们正确

115
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,199
with probability 0.62 so we have a

116
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,329
simple prediction based on the actual

119
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:25,389
left right and and so forth so if they

120
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:29,588
were doing this facing populations of

122
00:05:31,228 --> 00:05:32,619
are the payoffs then this is how they

123
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:35,139
should be behaving okay so what happens

00:05:35,339 --> 00:05:38,040
in the data let's take a peek
