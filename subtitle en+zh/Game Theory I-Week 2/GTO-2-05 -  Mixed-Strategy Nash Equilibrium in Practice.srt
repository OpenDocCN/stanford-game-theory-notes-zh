so now let's take a look at mixed
现在让我们来看看混合

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:06,519
strategy Nash equilibrium in practice
实践中的策略纳什均衡

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:08,080
yeah I've been trying to understand a

5
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,370
little bit about what it can tell us

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,419
they're ubiquitous in sports and
他们在运动中无处不在

12
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:25,329
competitive games so situations where it

13
00:00:25,528 --> 00:00:29,140
actually pays to be unpredictable so by

not knowing what the other the

16
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:34,000
little more difficult for you to pick an

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,750
situation where a kicker has to try and

this happens very quickly so it's

27
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,689
simplified version say to the right or

you ask me to kick it towards the left

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,378
so let's have a peek at this
让我们来看看

51
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:59,079
so the kicker who kicks penalty kicks

worse to the right than the left kick

58
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,330
with just the simple version

59
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,800
to get our ideas fixed so imagine that

60
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,290
the setting is one where the kicker and

61
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,200
a goalie if they so let's have the

62
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,930
kicker on this side so the kicker is the

63
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:28,330
row player the goalie is the column

66
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,580
also happens to go to the left then the

69
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,180
0 if instead we're in a situation where

71
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:51,719
goes right then the kicker scores and

72
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:54,430
gets a payoff of 1 and and so forth ok

73
00:02:54,629 --> 00:02:56,710
so this is just a simple variation on

77
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,240
it's just going to be that the kicker

78
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,259
randomizes equally between left and

82
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,950
right going left to right so it's a very

83
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:25,480
simple game and we have a good idea of

84
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,660
how to solve that one ok so now what are

85
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,610
we going to do let's change things and

86
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,090
now we've got a kicker who sometimes

87
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:36,520
misses when they go to the right so in

00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,509
scores 75% of the time but actually

misses completely 25% of the time okay
完全错过25％的时间

93
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,250
so this is a kicker who still does well

94
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:58,870
if they go left in the goalie goes to

95
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:00,879
the opposite direction but now they have

99
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,490
adjust what's what should the new

100
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:11,650
equilibrium look like so let's suppose

101
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,140
let's first of all try and keep the
让我们首先尝试保持

102
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,569
kicker indifferent so let's think of the
踢球者无动于衷，让我们想想

103
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,400
goalie going left with probability P
守门员以概率P向左走

104
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,520
right with probability 1 minus P for the
对的概率为1减去P 

105
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,528
kicker to be indifferent what has to be
踢球者无动于衷

106
00:04:23,728 --> 00:04:26,528
true well what's their payoff if they go
真的很好，如果他们去，他们的收益是什么

107
00:04:26,728 --> 00:04:27,160
left
剩下

108
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,649
their payoff to going left is just 1
他们向左走的收益只有1 

109
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:33,819
times 1 minus P their kickoff their
 1乘以P，他们的开球

110
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:38,410
payoff to going right is 0.75 times P
向右的收益是P的0.75倍

111
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,819
these two things have to be equal in
这两个条件必须相等

112
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:46,329
order to have this the kicker be
为了让这个踢球

113
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:49,059
indifferent so what do we end up with we
漠不关心，所以我们最终会得到什么

114
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:54,480
end up with 0.75 P is equal to 1 minus P
最终0.75 P等于1减去P 

115
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:06,100
so we end up with 1 equals 1.75 P or P
所以我们最终得到1等于1.75 P或P 

116
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,600
is equal to 1 over 1.75 which is equal
等于1.75等于1 

117
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,160
to 4 over 7 okay so that tells us that
到4比7好，这告诉我们

118
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,429
the goalie should be going left with
守门员应该和

119
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:21,519
probability 4/7 and right with
概率为4/7，右为

120
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:26,319
probability 3/7 okay so we know what the
概率为3/7，所以我们知道

121
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:27,819
goal is supposed to be doing so so now
目标应该现在就这样做

122
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:29,709
the fact that we changed the goalies
我们改变了守门员的事实

123
00:05:29,908 --> 00:05:31,838
payoffs haven't changed but the fact

124
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:33,278
that we changed the kicker's payoffs
我们改变了踢球者的收益

125
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:35,528
meant that the goalie actually had to
意味着守门员实际上不得不

126
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,420
adjust right so even though the goalies

127
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,889
payoffs haven't changed at all in this
收益根本没有改变

128
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,050
game the new equilibrium has a different
游戏中新的平衡有不同

129
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,269
set of probabilities for the goalie in
守门员的一组概率

130
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,100
order to keep the kicker and different
为了保持踢脚和不同

131
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,588
now okay so now let's let's see what the
现在好了，现在让我们看看

132
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:50,139
kicker is going to do so how we see
踢手将这样做，我们如何看

133
00:05:50,338 --> 00:05:52,019
what's so so let's suppose that the
怎么回事，让我们假设

134
00:05:52,218 --> 00:05:54,600
kicker goes left with probability Q
踢手以概率Q向左走

135
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,399
right with probability 1 minus Q and

136
00:05:57,598 --> 00:06:00,639
must solve for Q well for the goalie to
必须为守门员很好地解决Q 

137
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:03,160
be indifferent what is their payoff if

they go left if they're going left

they're getting and they're getting a Q

they getting they're just getting 1

00:06:21,329 --> 00:06:24,939
minus Q right so these two things have

to be equal so we end up with Q is equal

we work out this we get 3/7 for the

strategies looking like this as we made

157
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:16,389
this adjustment and we noticed two sort

158
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:20,290
of interesting things about this one is

that the goalies payoffs didn't change

but they still had to adjust their

161
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,430
strategies and the second is that the

kicker is actually kicking more often to

the kicker the the goalie has also made

an adjustment in this game and so the

the comparative statics in mixed

so let's have a look just through the

intuition here again in the goalie
